Its smell is acceptable. The size is large. The package is nice. Once used, you put it on the scalp and rub it softly, and then wash it from the hair. Its composition is something I did not like at all times. The quality is better than it.\n","Processing review 5 on page 2...\n","No 'Show more' button found for review 5 on page 2.\n","Review 5 text on page 2: It has no smell and the size of it is really big so I was excited, then when I used it then the day after I just had shedding (which is still normal because of the massage) and then my scalp started to itch and pimples appeared in my hair 🥲🥲🥲 Using the product is simply not good for sensitive hair so I don't recommend it Especially for this type of hair.\n","Processing review 6 on page 2...\n","No 'Show more' button found for review 6 on page 2.\n","Review 6 text on page 2: My hair scalp is oily, but I noticed that it does something, frankly, no refreshing and no strong cleaning.

I mean, there are exfoliants that are much better than it and clean the scalp. This one, I felt, is not good at all, but the cream and shampoo are better than it, honestly.\n","Processing review 8 on page 2...\n","No 'Show more' button found for review 8 on page 2.\n","Review 8 text on page 2: Nice formula of lotion in moisturizing the skin and suitable for sensitive skin and I like to repeat it..

I felt it was rough on the scalp. I prefer to use it once a week. As for the parting tool, I thought it would be easy. The tool was difficult, so I had to part my hair and put the product on my hair for 30 minutes, then wash my hair, then apply a hair mask for 30 minutes and see what happens. I went back to using it for the second use. To be honest, I do not recommend the scrub tool at all. It does not help. The product comes out. I had to cut it just to use the product.\n"]}],"source":["url = 'https://hk.iherb.com/r/mielle-clarifying-sugar-scalp-scrub-rosemary-mint-6-oz-170-g/138164?sort=6&ratings=1'\n","max_pages_to_scrape = 2\n","reviews = scrape_reviews(url, max_pages_to_scrape)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"awwCpUbHkPYR","outputId":"57ff6722-9fec-49ae-b27c-117d81a61878"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Reviews saved to ../data/reviews_dataset.csv\n"]}],"source":["product_id = re.search(r'/(\\d+)\\?', url).group(1)\n","output_csv = f'../data/reviews_dataset.csv'\n","rating = 1\n","\n","file_exists = os.path.isfile(output_csv)\n","\n","# Write the header row\n","with open(output_csv, mode='a' if file_exists else 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n","    writer = csv.writer(file)\n","    if not file_exists:  # Write the header only if the file is being created\n","        writer.writerow(['product_id','rating', 'review_text'])\n","\n","    # Write each review text as a row in the file with the rating\n","    for review_text in reviews:\n","        writer.writerow([product_id, rating, review_text])\n","\n","print(f'Reviews saved to {output_csv}')"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
