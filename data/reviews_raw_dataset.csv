108764,5,"The addiction to this shampoo is made up of herbs. She fell in love with it when she bought it for the second time. It gives shine to the hair and smells like ginger and other herbs. Its size is neither large nor small, in the middle of its size, and it does not cause hair loss. This means that it has become one of the essential shampoos in my life. I had to try the mask following it. Hopefully, it will come out with good expectations. Please be patient Please like and thank you. I am addicted to this site and take advantage of the offers. I took it on offer and it will stay with you for a month if you use it a lot. It smells like herbs. I liked it and the size is suitable."
108764,5,"The smell is sweet. It is not good to use. Two squeezes of it are enough for a lot of foam. Do not put it on the hair directly. And let the hair breathe, frankly, for my part, I can go back to take two boxes if I finish loving it and take the mask with it. Like if you benefit ‚ù§Ô∏è"
108764,5,"The smell is acceptable and good to use. I use it twice a week because it is strong on the hair and removes the fat that the follicle needs. Twice a week as an excellent cleaning.

Sweet moisturizing, not oil, I mean only"
108764,5,"The natural scent of herbs is pleasant, and even though I'm in my 50s, I feel shiny and smooth the next day. Why is it that even after using expensive shampoos and conditioners from a beauty salon that are recommended to me, they feel good for a few times, but after continued use, they start to feel unsatisfactory? (Maybe I was using the shampoo the wrong way?) This is the first time I've felt more satisfied after using it. After using this shampoo for about a month, my regular hairdresser told me, ``My hair is no longer frizzy!'' and I'm so happy. I would like to continue using this product because I can purchase it at a good price when there is a coupon."
108764,5,"It smells sweet and pleasant, I liked it, its use is very easy, it refreshes the hair, its size is medium, it comes without packaging, the color of the liquid is white and sticky, it cleans the hair and does not fluff it, and it foams, and you need two to three pressures, depending on the length of your hair, its density and frankness is excellent. For hair, I recommend the mask from the same group üíóüíó"

108764,5,"The best brand hair shampoo. You put it more on the scalp and wash it justly. The volume is enough, frankly, for those whose hair is long, and it is normal for daily use. The benefit of the shampoo is that it reduces hair loss from experience and gives moisturizing to the hair."

108764,5,"It was more comfortable to use than I expected. Each hair is firm, but it is also fine and wavy, making it difficult to manage. I am also concerned about the smell of my scalp, so I keep trying different shampoos and replacing them. This was a hit after a long time. When I used it, my hair felt well-managed as soon as I rinsed it off in the shower, and it was not slimy and the foam came off easily. The next morning, my hair was wavy but well-managed, so I was able to go out with just a little care. And by the evening, I didn't notice any scalp odor at all, which had been bothering me. The shampoo itself has a faintly refreshing scent that doesn't linger on my hair, but I was very happy that my scalp was odorless the next day. It seems to suit me, so I plan to continue using it for a while longer."
108764,5,"I have suffered from alopecia areata many times over the years, and have tried many different products due to severe hair loss caused by menopause, but this shampoo has been great.

108764,5,"First of all, the scent was very nice. It feels more like a moisturizer than a refreshing one, leaving your hair shiny and supple. The ingredients are safe and I feel that it is effective not only for the hair but also for the scalp. I look forward to continuing to use it and seeing the results."
108764,5,"The scent is different from the rosemary I've used so far, it's a grassy rosemary scent. If you're looking for a typical rosemary scent, it might not be what you're looking for. I have sensitive skin, and if I use a shampoo that doesn't suit me, I get pimples, but this shampoo worked for me without any problems. It's also easy to wash with, and it doesn't feel like it's catching on my hair."

108764,5,"My hair is thin and semi-long. It's gotten thinner as I've gotten older, and it's been wavy for a while now, so I bought this in hopes of hair growth and improving the frizz. It's a very thick shampoo, and one and a half pumps (about one teaspoon) creates a fluffy foam. The scent is still rosemary mint...refreshing. My hair stays together well all day, doesn't go flat until the evening, and the frizz has improved. This time I only purchased the shampoo, so next time I'll buy the conditioner as well.

108764,5,"Effective shampoo for hair growth! I had a hard time finding a shampoo that saved me from severe hair loss, there are a lot of new ones and it doesn‚Äôt smell overpoweringly pleasant. Convenient dispenser and packaging. Doesn‚Äôt foam much, but washes hair perfectly. Super quality. Perfect composition. Hair looks healthy ."

108764,5,"I tried a lot of different products on IHERB and this is the one I found. First of all, the scent is great! It leaves a soft scent. The size is also good. If it's too small, it feels expensive, but this is a good price. It feels moist and blends well with my hair. I have a lot of hair and it's a bit hard, but it's easy to wash. If the ingredients are gentle, this is really good, so I bought it again. If I could be greedy, I wish the label would be attached more firmly, as it was wrinkled."
108764,5,"It has a wild scent like when you lie in the grass while shampooing. Personally, I find my favorite scent soothing. I think the feel and ingredients are good. The packaging is also cute, so you can put it in your bath and get excited. If you use a line from the same series, it will be more effective."
108764,5,"I've been following the curly girl method for almost 3 years. I have been discovering the products that worked best for my hair type. My hair is fine, with highlights and little density, so the products immediately get dirty and give me weight. I follow the method in a simple and uncomplicated way, suitable products but with the most natural ingredients possible. I like Giovanni's botanical ingredients, Mielle's the mint and rosemary line, they have been an excellent discovery along with curlsmith. I have been using the styling cream from this same line for a long time, iHerb does not sell it, I buy it in Spain. It seems to me a smooth and respectful line with the needs of my hair, and my chemical sensitivity, that is why I decided to try this shampoo. I can say that I have finally found a shampoo that does not dry me out or itch or weigh me down or anything. I had tried several shea moisture shampoos that I did not love, and some from Giovanni, for me this one fulfills much better what I am looking for in a shampoo. I don't usually do cowash for my fine hair, it builds up a lot and gives me weight. It has a quite natural smell of mint and rosemary, it seems that it does not have colorants, which is to be appreciated. The dispenser of the bottle is a success. I will repeat without a doubt! Totally recommended !! If you have found my comment useful, I appreciate your giving me a thumbs up. Thanks!"
108764,5,"I've used many shampoos, but this one has a different feel to it than anything I've ever used before. It leaves my scalp feeling refreshed, but it doesn't leave a smooshing sensation on my skin, and it lathers up really well, but it doesn't have a chemical feel to it. Your hair will be left with a soft, light and shiny finish. It is also recommended for men who are concerned about thinning hair."
108764,5,"I was using another company's biotin shampoo, but it's been out of stock for a long time, so I tried this one. It doesn't feel squeaky after washing, which is great. The cleansing power isn't too strong, and it doesn't leave much of a scent behind. I'm in my 50s, and I've noticed less hair loss!"
108764,5,"Its smell is acceptable and needs no introduction, its method of use, its quality is excellent, its size is appropriate, its benefit is moisturizing the scalp and is suitable for all hair. I liked the product a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot Many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many"
108764,5,"I bought a hair mask from this company. Honestly, I was skeptical, but the result for my dry and frizzy hair was excellent! I decided to also buy shampoo from this line. The quality of the ingredients, the composition, everything is excellent, so the result is visible almost immediately. I recommend!"
108764,5,"The shampoo works well with the hair. I use it in combination with a mask from this line. At first, the first few times of use, I did not understand the effect, but over time the hair began to look great and improved in its structure. I alternate with other shampoos so as not to dry out my hair. Hair in general becomes less greasy, shiny, and its loss decreases"
108764,5,"The smell is good, used three times a week, the quality is good, the size is suitable for two months, the age is preferred for adults from 16 and above, the package of benefits, the portfolio of benefits, it cleans and refreshes the formula of rosemary and mint, the hair dries the scalp, refreshing, sensitive, moisturizing, no"

The benefit. I have had it for two weeks. I still have the result. Excellent composition. The hair and scalp are gentle, sensitive and moisturizing. You don't need a lot of conditioner that is too soft for the hair, but after the shower it feels fluffy."
108764,5,"This shampoo is designed to moisturize, nourish, strengthen hair, thanks to its composition containing biotin and herbs, it stops hair loss and reduces fragility! In addition to biotin, the composition contains extracts and essential oils: nettle, mint, rosemary, horsetail, ginger, chamomile, comfrey, as well as nourishing babassu, castor and coconut oil."
108764,5,"This company is taking literally all their products, I have nothing left and I can complete them except for gel. Unfortunately, it is not available to escape. I don‚Äôt know where to get it. The important thing is that the shampoo is nice, it lengthens the hair quickly because it contains rosemary and cleans the scalp from the heart that makes you moisturized because I felt it dries the hair even though I just put it on the scalp"
108764,5,"Great product! The quality is really great! The packaging is large, the composition is wonderful, suitable for damaged and dry hair, the smell of mint and rosemary is unobtrusive. Moisturizes, the scalp began to look better, suitable for sensitive skin. Shampoo will give a good result if used together with a mask. I have been using this shampoo and mask for 4 months already, I am very satisfied with the product, I recommend it üëçüèª"
108764,5,I bought this because my hair kept getting tangled and falling out. The rosemary scent is refreshing and nice. It lathers well and leaves my scalp feeling refreshed. It doesn't feel stiff at all after shampooing and it stays moisturized. My hair doesn't fall out as much and I feel like it's getting richer. I intend to repurchase.
108764,5,"I bought this after reading reviews. It's rosemary mint, so I thought it would have a more refreshing scent, but it has a gentle rosemary scent. It's aromatic. But I like this scent too. I was worried because I saw reviews saying it was squeaky, but I didn't feel any squeaky. But without the conditioner, it might be hard to use just shampoo. I'm glad I bought the conditioner as a set. My friend said, ""Your hair is so shiny! Did you use a conditioner?"" so it might be effective in making it shiny. I've used salon-exclusive shampoos before, but this one is more cost-effective, and the after-wash and manageability are just as good, so I'm thinking of buying this again. The size isn't too big, so it's just right for me."
108764,5,I haven‚Äôt used it but i have been using its oil for sometime right now and i have so many new baby hair now !! I was suffering from hair loss but this Rosemary helped me ! Will continue it and keep buying it ! Its amazing and scent is nice too !
108764,5,this is one of the best shampoos i have tried so far for my hair. i use this shampoo in combination with Mielle rosemary mint oil. i have been using this for only a couple of weeks and i can see baby hair growing. i can feel that the growth of my hair boosted.
108764,5,"Excellent shampoo with the addition of biotin. The smell of rosemary and mint leaves the hair soft. I use it and then apply a rosemary hair mask from the same series. Good size. I have really long hair, so I use a relatively large amount of shampoo in each wash. Recommended! If you liked the review, give it a like üòä"
108764,5,"Good sulfate shampoo. Not aggressive. Gives volume to hair. The composition is excellent. I have fine, curly, very dry hair."
108764,5,"Holy grail shampoo!!! Cleanses my scalp really well, and I‚Äôve noticed its not drying (I have oily scalp for reference and very dry hair). The bottle lasts me between 2-3 months as I wash my hair frequently, which shows that a little goes a long way with this shampoo."
108764,5,Have yet to use it but heard lots of good things about it. Decided to get 2 as this shampoo sells out fast and have to wait for months to stock up. The smell is pleasant too.
108764,5,"When I wanted to get rosemary oil, this shampoo caught my attention, and I expected that the quality would be excellent, as is the case with the oil, so I bought it to use it in conjunction with the use of the oil. The shampoo has a distinct combination of rosemary and mint, and thus helps moisturize the scalp and relieve itching, as well as contributes to nourishing the follicles and thus making the hair more healthy and vibrant. I put a little shampoo in my hands after I wet my hair and massage the scalp and ends well..

108764,5,"From the first experience, I liked it very much. It cleans from the heart and is more suitable for oily hair"
108764,5,"Great size and excellent quality, my hair is very soft in terms of hygiene and cleans my scalp perfectly"
108764,5,It's crazy. I took a kiss of oil and the quality. I liked it. I said I took the whole set. Excellent for hair and scalp. The benefit is that it nourishes the hair. The size of the packaging is easy to use.
108764,5,"Great smell and great scalp feeling. The product is easy to use and I'm glad it's vegan. The composition is without additives and, as already mentioned, a unique fragrance. Revives the hair and gives shine. Goodbye frizz and hello super healthy hair. Also for sensitive scalps! Your hair will be moisturized."
108764,5,"Great shampoo that cleanses the hair without irritating the scalp. The scent is mild enough and it doesn‚Äôt stay too long in the hair, which I personally prefer, because I use other styling products afterwards. No nasty chemicals so it won‚Äôt cause any irritation."
108764,5,"I recently came across a shampoo that boasts great quality and clean ingredients, which initially caught my attention. While I haven‚Äôt fully tested it yet, I‚Äôve been impressed with what I‚Äôve seen so far. The ingredient list is simple and free from harmful chemicals, which is a big plus for me. It‚Äôs refreshing to find a product that seems to prioritize both health and effectiveness. The packaging is also quite sleek and elegant, giving it a premium feel. Although it‚Äôs still too early to give a complete verdict, I have high hopes that it will live up to its promising start. For now, I can say that it‚Äôs off to a great beginning. Great mint scent too."
108764,5,So I tried it for one time and i instantly fell in love .. it cleanses the hair without stripping it haven‚Äôt seen growth but under surveillance I really love this brand Tried so many shampoos many were not cleansing and others stripped my hair but this one really got the best of 2 worlds
108764,5,Nice shampoo I bought it with the mask and styling cream from same brand it‚Äôs has nice smell and good with the hair. Still trying it hope it will help growth baby hair
108764,5,"I use it over clean hair, little bit wet then i scalp with herbal shampoo i feel my hair thick Good quality good taste and ingredient, use frequency every day depends on age , good package size and benefit"
108764,5,I bought two of this because of how great it is the package size lasts u for a long time the products and composition quality is perfect the scent is nice it moisturizes my hair perfectly it's not harsh on the sensitive scalp use it after detoxing shampoo to get better benefits
108764,5,This is my first time to use it and honestly it gives my have softness as well as volume and very moisturizing. The package size is fair enough the scent is very nice. One of the best quality shampoo I‚Äôve used and I think I will keep on using it. I‚Äôm so satisfied with.
108764,5,"Very good product for hair, I recommend that brand it grows the hair and makes it nice ."
108764,5,Shampoo easy to use on my hair in my showers and scent is rosemary mint. Package is big in size
108764,5,"Love the product, it smells so so good, cleanses the hair. Best choice for growth, hair fall control, strong hair. My favourite brand. Doesn't irritate sensitive scalp Moisturizes it"
108764,4,I use it once and i already noticed the difference between it and the one i use it before
108764,4,"The quantity is good, but I haven't used it yet. It seems very good. I will use it and see how effective it is. I hope it is of the required quality."
108764,4,"Good shampoo for healthy hair, only need small amount, smells good but not too strong, rinses clean"
108764,4,"I ordered it because it's popular, but I'm not sure yet, but I think it's good."
108764,4,"Excellent package, suitable size, excellent quality, beautiful scent, used two days a week"
108764,4,"My skin feels a bit heavy after washing. I was hoping for a smooth feeling, so it's disappointing. I'll continue using it."
108764,4,"Nice consistence and good smell, not to much smell. Good for sensitive skin. The bottle last for a long time, it is foaming well in the hair and the hair feels clean without being too dry after use."
108764,4,"I bought it based on the review and because it contains rosemary. I hope I benefit from it. Its smell is good, but I was afraid it would be annoying."
108764,4,"I deducted a star so they don't increase the price üò¨ Anyway.. It has a nice fresh scent, I think mint, and a nice, normal lather. The quantity is good. As for me, my hair is thin and I can use it for months. It cleans the hair well, even the scalp, but I felt it was a bit drying, so I need to moisturize after showering. As for the hair loss, it was terrible after giving birth and suddenly it decreased a bit, but I don't know if it is from the oil and shampoo or the henna."
108764,4,Love the scent but i've used much much better.
108764,4,"I use it and my hair is oily, but I don‚Äôt feel that it cleans the hair well. It needs to be accompanied by a purifying shampoo that you use at least two days a week."
108764,4,"Excellent for hair products, I tried it after ordering it based on the advice of my nutritionist and today is the sixth day and I feel somewhat better‚Ä¶."
108764,4,It has a very natural fragrance. My scalp feels very clean after use. I have oily hair and it feels very refreshing after use. The amount is a bit small for me. I use it every day but overall I am very satisfied with it.
108764,4,"The scent is not good but the package, size, quality are good I used it many times benefits my hair and scalp Moisturized my hair"
108764,4,"I bought it hoping for a minty scent, but it smelled like cucumber lol. It's not transparent, but a pearly color shampoo like Dove body soap. I feel like it gives my hair volume."
108764,4,"The smell is very amazing and the use is very easy to use, the quality, size, lifespan, packaging and benefit are fire and the formula is sensitive and gentle. Repeat concerns"
108764,4,"Enriched with soothing Aloe Vera Anti-aging Vitamin C Targets dark spots, uneven tone and expression lines Gives you clearer skin"
108764,4,"I love this shampoo, rosemary mint perfect for growth and itching"
108764,4,Easy used Good quality Size s normal and good Packing good
108764,4,"It smells good. I haven't used it for long, but after I bought it, I saw many people saying it caused hair loss."
108764,4,One of the best shampoos I have ever used. It is really amazing.
108764,4,"The rosemary shampoo has a nice texture and cleanses well, leaving my hair feeling soft and manageable. However, I‚Äôm not a fan of the smell, which I find a bit overpowering. While it works effectively, the scent might not be for everyone. Overall, it's a good shampoo if you're okay with the fragrance. Cleans very good."
108764,4,"The smell is beautiful as if you were in the high mountains and the use is as described and I took the serum with it to give faster results. The size is economical and the quantity is good. The package is original and of good quality. The benefit is clean, shiny hair with a scent and I am still looking forward to results in thickening the hair"
108764,4,Good product shampoo for hair loss that maintains the scalp
108764,4,"I return to the evaluation in terms of quality, price, benefit, use and package size."
108764,4,Beautiful and gives hair moisture and original quality Non-irritating smell It has become a daily care Large size Refreshes sensitive scalp Easy and large packaging Benefits Makes hair moisturized Skin feels soft Easy to use Suitable for all ages Immediate benefit Refreshing formula
108764,4,I liked the smell and quality of the product and the packaging is easy to use. The shampoo is rich and lasts for a long time.
108764,4,"The product smells great and the quality is good, but I don't feel it's suitable for me to use and I don't see any benefit for me"
108764,4,"It's nice, but I felt that it dries the hair a bit. My hair is oily and it might be suitable for it. I'm still trying it."
108764,4,Quality and package is goood my age 25y size is okt also easy to use
108764,4,"Very pleasant smell, refreshes the scalp. Hair is a little less greasy. I don't feel like it's falling out less, but it's become thicker, more volume."
108764,4,Just start to use it hopefully it works for my hair size is very small i like the scent. Will write again if i got any benefit but at the moment is moisturizer my hair well
108764,3,Works reasonably well but I didn‚Äôt realise this had artificial fragrances in it. Why‚Äôs it harp on about being organic and natural then contain estrogenic fragrances?
108764,3,Under testing and use. I hope it is as described. Under testing and use. I hope it is as described. Under testing and use. I hope it is as described.
108764,3,"It smells good, its size is medium, the same as the one in the picture, the packaging is excellent, it has a comfortable feeling, it is a nice feeling when I use something from the herbs, it gives me a good feeling"
108764,3,"It's very normal. It takes more than its share. It doesn't clean properly. If you oil your hair or put on a mask, the hair stays matted. It does foam, but it doesn't dry oily hair completely. Its smell isn't herbal, it's not a nice, fragrant smell. I didn't see any difference in hair loss or anything else. I use it, reassured that it's organic. If it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt, instead of economical shampoos."
108764,3,Very good light scent and lots of foam I would buy it again
108764,3,"Smells great, foams up nicely, doesn't tangle hair. I expected that I would start washing my hair less often, but the shampoo leaves a strange feeling of not being washed, and the scalp is already quite oily on the second day."
108764,3,"The smell is normal, the hair becomes softer, but the amount of hair loss increases"
108764,3,"I used it to prevent hair loss, but it didn't seem to have much effect on me."
108764,3,Nice minty scent. Into 2nd bottle. Scalp still greasy despite daily use. Don't really see improvement in hair fall.
108764,3,"It's nice, but I feel it dries out my hair and doesn't suit me. I need conditioner and high hydration."
108764,3,It did not suit my hair because my hair is oily and I like shampoo that cleans the scalp well
108764,3,"Initially, I was attracted by the composition of this shampoo and the positive comments. But in reality, it didn‚Äôt impress me much: I didn‚Äôt like how my scalp felt after using it (it was already dry and seemed to become even drier) and my hair felt to the touch. I used the shampoo several times and realized that I didn‚Äôt want to continue. I gave it to a friend who wanted to try it. But she wasn‚Äôt thrilled with it either. However, shampoos, like creams and other personal care products, are very subjective ‚Äì and although it didn‚Äôt suit me and my friend, it may suit many other people just fine. By the way, the shampoo smells very nice!"
108764,3,It cleanses the scalp but dries it a bit. I didn‚Äôt use it daily. Once a week is enough. The result is normal for now. I might have had to use the serum with it.
108764,3,"After the second box of use, I noticed that hair loss increased, but the softness and smoothness of the hair are very good."
108764,3,"Romario scent, use on wet hair, excellent quality, hair loss decreased from the first use. After 4 times, my hair no longer falls out at all."
108764,3,I didn‚Äôt love it that much it made my hair a little bit stronger BUT I do have normal to oily hair so if my got greasy I wouldn‚Äôt use it does not clean my hair when it‚Äôs greasy but i do love if my was already clean and need to shower with out damaging my hair because it doesn‚Äôt contain sulfate or any chemicals. The size is good . Quality is very nice . The scent also is light . Recommended specially if you have dry scalp
108764,2,"the scent is nice, the quality composition of the lather and sud is thick and a little goes a long way but i did notice that my hair was falling out a bit. Everyone was saying that they noticed that on tiktok and its true :( not sure if someone's messing with her ingredients or that's just how it is now but i remember when i ordered before it didn't cause my hair to do that"
108764,2,"First of all, I really liked the way it lathered in my scalp, very soapy and bubbly. Kind of a struggle to completely rinse out the shampoo. The scent smells really nice and minty! Unfortunately, it left my hair with a weird residue/film no matter how hard I rinse my hair. The packaging is very easy to use tho."
108764,2,This product made my hair feel excessively greasy even after washing and did not help with hair fall at all.
108764,2,edit: i originally gave it for stars but i'm changing my review after using it for a while. I have oily scalp/dry ends kind of hair and wash my hair every two days. with this shampoo i have to wash my hair everyday because it makes my scalp oily. cant recommend.
108764,2,"I really wanted to love this but.. maybe it just doesn't work for fine straight hair. I bought this along with the oil, which I leave on my scalp for an hour and then wash out. I even tried washing my hair 3(!!!) times with it and it still was left oily.. I then tried a different shampoo and my hair wasn't oily anymore. the scent is very subtle, I personally didn't really like it though."
108764,1,"I really didn't like the shampoo, my hair is still greasy when I use it, my hair falls out more when I wash it, I don't know how it helps to stop hair loss, I just started losing hair and it made my hair greasy... I think I won't buy it again.."
108764,1,"I had so big expectation regarding this product, but unfortunately it did nothing, absolutely nothing. My hear was so creasy after using this shampoo. I was using oil, also mielle same line shampoo and conditioner. I used it regularly more than 2 month, but my hear now looks even worth :( so disappointed üòî"
108764,1,"i have purchased the full Mielle hair care products after the hype they got, after 2 weeks of use (I barely could use them) i wouldn't recommend them to anyone! before i mention if they help with hair growth i would like to mention how they leave your hair super super greasy even after shampooing multiple times! i even tried to use separately to detect which item causes this grassiness yet it didnt work, your hair would like like you showered with pure oil. i didnt like at all. scent is minty. size is relatively small."
108764,1,"I bought the whole range looking forward to go on my hair growth journey but have literally lost so much hair from this brand. It is the only thing I changed and the second I started using it my hair started falling out, I was confused but have realised this is what caused it. I am so sad, my scalp is shining/balding and my thickness is completely gone so now I need to find something else to fix what I thought this would do. So disappointed and shocked how much it is recommend - maybe it is not for my hair type which is normal wavy/straight fine hair. I do not recommend for that type of hair anyway and had to throw it all away which was such a waste because no-one I knew, wanted it. Maybe they should try make it nicer and better version for fine hair people who need thickening and hair growth."
108764,1,"Initially, it felt like it cleaned the scalp well from buildup of product and sebum. Leaves the hair nice and clean. I noticed my hair becomes slightly oily after some time, however the scalp will not smell funky.. UPDATE: started experiencing massive hair loss after using it for some time.. not sure if it is the shampoo or another reason..switched to another brand and voila.. hairloss immediately stops"
124721,5,"The first time I felt that social media spoke about its work, it is truly amazing. The first time in my life I use a conditioner that does not pull hairs out of me with lotion. Mashallah, this is awesome. This company, all of its products, are worth the money, and it deserves someone to keep praising it every day. I have not told anyone about them and their benefits. Quality is 100. 100,% What causes any sensitivity to the scalp?"
124721,5,"I love the refreshing scent of rosemary and mint! It's perfect for the coming season! My shampoos tend to be quite thick, so this conditioner is light and refreshing, which is perfect! I've already started buying it again, and since I started using this series, I've noticed a lot of baby hairs growing around my forehead üíï"
124721,5,"I used it in the shampoo and series. The scent is gentler than shampoo, and you can only feel it when drying, and it doesn't leave a trace. I like the smooth finish because I have short, curly hair that has not been colored. If you have long hair or are concerned about hair loss, a hair mask may be a good option. I've been using my favorite hair care product for years, and this one is just as comfortable to use, so I'll add it to my regular list."
124721,5,Peace be upon you. My hair is falling out and there is dandruff. I had to change it and change it. I have received it and I use a full package. I will show you my hair before and after and come back. Comments on Commenter. Smell. Use. Quality. Size. Age. Package. Benefit. Formula. Wash. Sensitive to the hair and moisturizing every time we start. Comments on Commenter.
124721,5,"Great conditioner, quality and smell. It gives mint moisturizing. Honestly, it is amazing. It softens the hair and I felt the difference. My hair is dry and dyed a lot, but it gives it excellent moisturization. I leave it on my hair for 3 minutes and rinse it with water. Usage: I use the entire set of conditioner, shampoo and conditioner. The size and the package are large."
124721,5,"A conditioner rich in biotin, an ingredient that helps increase hair length and enhance its overall health. Thanks to its enhanced formula with Rosemary and Peppermint, the conditioner moisturizes the hair and scalp, making it easier to style and making it softer. Its most important feature is that it is completely free of parabens, sulfates, and mineral oils. In short, it is an ideal choice to improve and improve the health of your hair in a natural and safe way. I advise you to use the entire line (shampoo, mask, and serum) to get the best results. Like please ü´∂üèªüíó"
124721,5,It has a rosemary scent and is easy to use. It has a very high nuttiness. Its size is considered good and the packaging is very nice. It has a very good benefit for the hair. It has a formula that stimulates the scalp so that it becomes long and thick.
124721,5,"The Miele Strengthening Conditioner in the Rosemary Blend has become a staple in my hair care routine. This conditioner is simply amazing. The rosemary blend not only leaves my hair smelling fresh and invigorating, but it also provides deep nourishment and strength to my locks. I've noticed a significant reduction in hair breakage and improved manageability since using this product. The formula is lightweight and doesn't weigh my hair down, yet it leaves it feeling soft, smooth, and incredibly healthy. If you're looking for a conditioner that promotes strong, luscious hair, the Miele Strengthening Conditioner, Rosemary Blend is a must-try."
124721,5,"Recently, maybe because I'm getting older, my hair quality has changed and I've started to worry about hair loss, so I bought this shampoo and mask. I didn't buy the conditioner at the time, so I bought that too! I really like this series and the scent! I'm thinking of using the mask less frequently and using the conditioner instead! The size and appearance are small, but it feels thick and you only need a small amount, so I think the price is reasonable. It moisturizes and gives firmness! It's also good for the scalp, so I recommend it! It leaves a refreshing finish, so I think it's perfect for this coming season!"
124721,5,"There is no smell, it has permanent use, the quality is amazing, the size is suitable for use for all ages, the packaging is appropriate, the benefits are very great and amazing. The comprehensive formula does not cause allergic reactions to the skin. Gentle and smooth. It can be repeated twice a week. There are no concerns about using it. I highly recommend it. I do not hesitate to buy it. I highly recommend buying it. It is a wonderful product and it is not the first time I have bought it regularly"
124721,5,"A product that I was looking for a lot on the Internet and it pleasantly surprised me! Within a week you will see the results, really pleasant use for the hair with the smell of rosemary which is God, no need to talk about quality because you must have heard of me, the quality is simply excellent! Sufficient size, smooth texture, revitalizes hair, moisturizes hair, sensitive scalp, full of benefits. Nice packaging and also not suitable for any age, check first."
124721,5,"Even when I was washing it, my hair already felt good to the touch, and after drying it, it became shiny and firm, and even after a while, it was so smooth that I wanted to touch it all the time!"
124721,5,It‚Äôs good it may smell strong but it gets the job done very well Scalp:I don‚Äôt put it to my scalp because you shouldn‚Äôt I use it after the hair mask or the shampoo The packaging is perfect You‚Äôre hair can‚Äôt be sensitive because you use it only on you‚Äôre ends It moisturizes my hair
124721,5,"I bought it as a set with the shampoo. The scent is aromatic and I like it. There were a lot of reviews saying that the hair was dry, but when I used it, it didn't creak when I washed it off, and it felt really smooth after drying! I'm thinking of repeating it."
124721,5,"I use it together with the shampoo. It's not heavy or sticky, and my scalp feels refreshed even after two days. The scent is not particularly minty, but a refreshing natural scent. When I use it, my hair is left smooth and fluffy. I love both the shampoo and the product."
124721,5,"The smell is light mint. Use is applied to the hair, focusing on flattery. The quality is very excellent. The size is 355 ml. The package is as shown in the picture. The package comes with a squeeze bottle. The benefit is to strengthen and moisturize the hair. An excellent formula to help moisturize the hair. I recommend it and all of Miley‚Äôs products. They are good and excellent, and all people praise them. I bought the whole set and use it. From the beginning"
124721,5,"The quality is excellent, the ingredients are great, the quantity is sufficient for a long period of time, minerals, a wonderful composition, the packaging is enough for two months, the benefit is the taste is normal, there are no symptoms, a nutritional supplement and treats deficiency."
124721,5,"Thank you. It is very suitable for me and I really liked it. I want to reuse it. Its size is appropriate and the quantity is appropriate. Thank you, Iherb. Thank you. Indeed, the price is appropriate and I do not want to use it. It does not taste bad."
124721,5,"I also use the shampoo as part of the set. My hair is a little dry and brittle, but it manages to stay in place without any problems. The scent is also refreshing and not unpleasant. I recommend it for those who don't like heavy, sweet scents. The texture is not too heavy, so it was just right for me."
124721,5,"It's amazing. I took the whole set of shampoo, conditioner, oil and mask, and when it's finished, I'll go back and get it again."
124721,5,"the conditioner is great for my hair, I use it once every two days and it is moisturizing, the scent is very beautiful and it does not over moisturize, meaning it does not make hair greasy. the size is fair and the quality is good. I recommend this product the composition of this product and this brand is great materials."
124721,5,"Wonderful, beautiful, easy to use. Not the first time I bought it. Excellent size. Excellent packaging. Its composition should not be applied to the scalp, only the ends."
124721,5,I'm glad that it smells like I just came back from the salon and it even conditions my hair. This is the best conditioner I have purchased from iherb. It also moisturizes well
124721,5,"I like the shampoo and oil, so I also bought the conditioner and hair mask! I will repeat it again!"
124721,5,"I have never been in the habit of using conditioner. As we age, our hair quality begins to deteriorate after dyeing our hair to cover gray hair, and we lose hair, so we start using conditioner. I tried it immediately after receiving it. It has a natural and comfortable fragrance, and the smoothing effect on my hair is also very good. There is significantly less hair fall when blow-drying. I purchased the same shampoo."
124721,5,"I started using this oil and shampoo. The gentle green scent is soothing. The size is smaller than typical Japanese shampoos, so I'm worried about the cost performance, but I'll try using it and decide whether to repeat. It seems good for both the scalp and hair, so I'd like to continue using it."
124721,5,"No, I haven't received it yet. No, Ingredients, Taste, Usage, Size, Package, Quantity, Like"
124721,5,"I have curly, thick hair that gets really frizzy and unmanageable after using a hair dryer, but after using this product, my hair feels firmer. I also like the rosemary mint scent. I use it alternately with the treatment from the same series."
124721,5,"It's very light to use. The refreshing scent of rosemary and mint is refreshing. If you have dry hair, I recommend using both the conditioner and treatment."
124721,5,"The scent is the best. There's nothing else like it. I also like that it keeps my curly hair smooth and moisturized. It doesn't dry out my hair, which is nice. I use two, one in the bathroom and one on my phone (for the gym). The size is just right. I'll definitely be buying it again."
124721,5,"Smell, use, quality, size, age, packaging, benefit, composition, hair and scalp. Mili‚Äôs products are more than wonderful and deserve their due"
124721,5,"The smell is amazing. Easy to use, apply the gel to the hair for 5 minutes"
124721,5,"Its smell, composition, and quality are amazing. The size and lifespan of the package is very sufficient. It can last for six months. The full size is great. There is no need to talk about the benefit. It is more beneficial. The result after use is 10,000,000%. It is not normal. It is amazing in terms of hair loss, prevents dandruff on the scalp, and gives amazing moisture. The smell is amazing. It is very sensitive after that. Usage: Hair is very soft and curled"
124721,5,"It has a gentle cream-like texture and a pleasant rosemary scent. After washing, your hair will be smooth and the scent will last until the next day. I think it would be good if it could provide nutrients to the scalp."
124721,5,"Good composition, prompted me to buy this product. The quality is good, there are no complaints, it does not cause any extraneous reactions. The hair became softer and easier to comb, less tangled. I use shampoo from another company, but in the future I will order from this one. It's simple to use, apply to damp hair, hold for 5-10 minutes and rinse. The smell of mint and rosemary is pleasant and relaxing. The packaging is convenient. Hair is soft and moisturizing. I'm satisfied and will order more."
124721,5,"The shampoo leaves the scalp feeling refreshed, and the conditioner leaves the hair feeling moisturized. It smells great! The natural, gentle scent of rosemary and mint refreshes the mind. My scalp and pores feel refreshed and comfortable, so I can fall asleep much easier."

124721,4,"After rinsing out the shampoo, my hair feels shiny, but when I apply conditioner as instructed and leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing it out, the ends of my hair feel a bit rough. When I dry it, the hair feels shiny and bouncy except for the ends, so I think the damage to the ends of my hair is quite severe. The scent is a little stronger than the shampoo, but I like herbal scents so it doesn't bother me too much."
124721,4,"He is excellent. I have very dry hair and it fell out a lot. After starting to use this group, hair loss decreased significantly. My hair is still dry, but it has become stronger"

124721,4,"I've developed a sensitive scalp as I get older and I'm always trying to find something to address my itchy scalp issue. I decided to try this conditioner because of the good reviews and so far so good. The only thing I don't like is the scent. Good thing it's not overpowering. It doesn't smell like either rosemary or mint, more of a heavy cosmetic scent that doesn't smell refreshing. But I'll stick with this as long as I don't get itchy scalp."
124721,4,"Amazing my hair stays moisturized after using it, leave it for 5 mins"
124721,4,its a really nice compliment after the use of the shampo version of this and my hair feels bouncy

124721,4,"Its size is nice, its smell is nice, and it moisturizes, but of course it is not very moisturizing. I have to apply cream after the shower, and that is not enough."
124721,4,i enjoy using this because the scent which is relaxing but invigorating at the same time.
124721,4,Used this product and line before for their oil. Haven‚Äôt used conditioner much but so far so good. Feels like a quality product with food scent.
124721,4,"The smell is chemical. not the same as in olive oil, here it is like an unreal scent of rosemary and mint. The packaging is ordinary, a convenient dispenser. The composition is not bad, the hair is light after use. The quality is normal, it is still too early to talk about the benefits. The size of the bottle is large, the use is economical. I use the entire line, but I will not return to this conditioner again"
124721,4,"The product is highly praised by users for its high quality and ease of use after shampooing. The scent is nice and the ingredients are effective, as it contains biotin, which increases the length and health of hair. The packaging is excellent and the size is suitable for daily use.

124721,4,Great product. Very satisfied. I highly recommend this product
124721,3,I ordered it for my client. I did not try it. I think it is good. Glory be to God and praise be to Him
124721,3,"I took the set (oil - shampoo - conditioner - mask). I loved them and I still have two weeks to use them, but I like the result so far."
124721,3,"I loved it and it's a cute and small size. Like . Delicious smell üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•. Nice quality, easy to carry packaging"
124721,3,great size and quality doesn't have the best scent but seems to work with my hair
124721,3,Good one but I didn‚Äôt notice any changes in my hair Moisturize hair fine
124721,3,"Strong smell, quality looks good, but I haven't seen a change in my hair yet, I'll update"
124721,3,It has a refreshing feel and leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky after washing. The mint scent is strong and lasts a long time. It may not be enough for those who like a moisturizing feeling.
124721,3,"I don‚Äôt know if the rosemary content will help my hair, but my hair will become very soft after using it."
124721,3,"The smell is beautiful, mint with rosemary. It is used after shampoo on the ends of the hair. It does not cause allergies for people who suffer from allergies. The moisturizing is good, but there is better than it. My rating for the product is 7/10. The package and size are large and will suffice for more than a month. The shampoo from the same product is very good, but frankly I did not like the conditioner. I wrote my comment with all honesty. I hope that the girls who write will be honest."
124721,3,"Use it five minutes after shampoo and wash it. It moisturizes the hair, not on the scalp but on the ends."
124721,3,"The product is nice, and I noticed that my hair began to grow longer as I continued using it, but it seemed to dry my hair that it did not suit me very well"
124721,3,It's not worth all the fuss. It moisturizes the hair and is better to use once a week
124721,3,"I constantly order from iHerb because it is excellent, and every month I order things from them for the home"
124721,3,"An average conditioner, I don't feel it's doing much in terms of growing my hair."
124721,2,"I bought this along with the shampoo hoping for hair growth effects. I've tried a lot of hair care products that are gentle on the scalp because they make my hair rough, but this product also tangles my hair. I had high hopes because I read reviews that said that adding conditioner makes my hair smooth, but no matter how much I apply, my hair is so tangled that it's difficult to comb through. It's actually easier to run your fingers through it at the shampoo stage. Am I using it wrong? ? Is it not suitable for long hair?"
124721,2,unlike the oil this conditioner smells a bit weird!!! I have been using it but I haven‚Äôt seen any good change. It‚Äôs not moisturising either and the hair dries out after using it. I‚Äôm not sure if I want to buy it again! it might be not suitable for my hair
124721,2,"not a good smell, its smell like iron, didn't like it. noüëé change in my hair, feel the hair is not clean after bathing.good package, fair size, high price . will not rebuy."
124721,2,"It makes the hair oily. I didn‚Äôt like it on the ends, of course, but I used it and I felt that my hair became oily, as if I hadn‚Äôt washed it."
124721,1,"Please, do not buy this. I was influenced because of the brand name. This has made my hair fall out in huge amounts. I have the shampoo and conditioner. Do not fall for the trend, do not use this."
124721,1,"Honestly, I bought it based on the benefits it would bring. I don‚Äôt know what the formula is, but it might have changed because it made all my hair fall out. I took it based on my friend‚Äôs review that it gave me baby hair, and I saw this with my own eyes. I expect there are things they changed that they don‚Äôt want to say because the amount of hair that fell out, and I used it two or three times, would have made me bald."
124721,1,"The product actually shocked me. If I had put it on less than a star, my hair felt like a loofah and very, very rough to the point that it would not be combed and had no tangles, even though I have the complete collection and everything is awesome. The mask, shampoo, and oil are awesome, but the conditioner is very, very bad. I don‚Äôt know if there is a problem with the product. Or something is wrong because in my life I have never seen my hair become like this, as if it were burlap threads, not hair.. Am I supposed to complain about them or what do I not know!!!!!"
124721,1,"I used it many times and it destroyed my hair. I dried it repeatedly and I had a lot of hair and strands that were white in an unnatural way. It is not worth being honest about again. I used it, and it's destroyed my hair and made it dry and healthy less and because of it a lot of my hair get white, i only had it when i used it"
110487,5,"I‚Äôm reviewing this product after 1 month of using it twice a week, the results is wonderful you even see my baby-hair in the photo , and given the price is really miraculous i will buy it again and again Please like my comment if you find it useful"
110487,5,"Size of the bottle is reasonable, package is very nice, I‚Äôm suffering from hair loss, I use it twice a week I put it on the scalp only for 10 minutes, I have sensitive scalp and the oil does not cause any itching. Results so far is acceptable. I‚Äôve noticed baby hair will keep on using it."
110487,5,"My favorite hair oil this is the second time buying it. I use it 3 times a week sometimes more sometimes less it depends it makes my hair loss less and I noticed new baby hairs after using it I keep it in my scalp for 30 min to an hour and 10 minutes before going to the shower I apply it on the ends. I use one pump from the applicator on the whole scalp. Very nice, highly effective."
110487,5,I ordered this for my friend. This is her second bottle and she says that it‚Äôs amazing and she saw a difference in her hair growth. it doesn‚Äôt make you feel scalp dry and moisturize the hair and it makes it feel soft and you can see results

110487,5,Okay so I really like this hair oil. It definitely makes a difference in my hair and helps make my hair soft and smooth. Helps with the fly away baby hairs as well. I usually take a whole dropper worth and rub it in my hands and then smooth it all over my hair and take more to really soak the dry ends of my hair. Then I put some on my scalp and rub it in good and let it sit for about 30 minutes and take a shower afterwards like regular with shampoo and conditioner. It really makes my hair soft and I can tell a difference when I use this. I recommend trying it out. It‚Äôs only a few bucks and worth it!

110487,5,"If you want a healthier scalp with less itchiness and flakiness, stronger, softer hair with reduced breakage, and a refreshing rosemary and mint scent, Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil is perfect. Why I fell in love with this oil from the first use is: it‚Äôs free of parabens, sulfates, paraffins, mineral oil, DEA, and is cruelty-free. Even though I haven‚Äôt been using this oil for long, the results are fantastic. My hair is softer and silkier, and I adore the rosemary and mint scent. For scalp treatment, I part my hair into sections, apply the oil with the dropper, and massage it in to reduce dryness and flakiness. Daily use involves a smaller amount to keep hair hydrated without greasiness. For split ends, I apply generously to the ends, cover with a plastic cap for 10 minutes, then rinse and shampoo. If you find this review helpful, please like my review. Happy Shopping!"

I would say this lasts me for a month since I oil my scalp every 2 days. I‚Äôve bought this so many times and I recommend everyone in buying this. I bought this so many times, it‚Äôs the best"
110487,5,I am in love with this product the quality of the oil itself you can tell by the smell it is very very good quality and the packaging is very secure as well considering it is made of glass. The rosemary oil is the only oil that has been proven scientifically to help hair growth

I was using this oil twice a week , after applying evenly on my scalp I would wear plastic bag in order to keep it warm. The scent of oil is soft minty. It does miracles,after using it constantly my hair start to grow very fast !"
110487,5,"I bought this oil in March, and till June I used it with no system. Now the bottle is empty, so I can make a review. Personally, it's strange for me when I use something for hair growth and totally don't feel tingling or chilling from the product, sometimes I think it doesn't work. How wrong I was! I got a lot of little hairs on my head, I see how strong they became in general when I wash my hair and see just a few hairs fell after it. The only problem was personal: I don't like oily products, I prefer indelible serums or sprays instead because it's easier to use and faster, too. Anyway it was easy to apply this oil as it has a dropper. Size is nice. It was an experiment for me to buy this product, and after using I totally recommend it!"

(I also use it throughout the entire lengths of my hair sometimes too.) After double washing my hair, my scalp feels SO clean and fresh -- like I really got a deep cleanse. I find it really helps to remove minor dandruff and product buildup. I don't know if I've been using it long enough to notice stronger & longer hair as a result, but it feels like I'm already noticing those results. My hair has never felt so thick & healthy."
110487,5,I‚Äôve tried dozens of scalp oils and without a doubt this one is the best. It helps moisturize and increase hair growth. I have a sensitive scalp and it hasn‚Äôt bothered it once. I will actually use it for itchy scalp if I‚Äôm having issues. I put it on my scalp right after the shower and brush it into my hair. It can be a bit greasy. So you can use it as a pre scalp oil prior to showering. Just try to let that quality liquid gold sit on your scalp for as long as possible! The smell is pleasant and not off putting at all.
110487,5,"My hair was damaged and this hair oil added life and shine to it, what I like about the product is the quality and the scent is really pleasant.

110487,5,"The scent of this scalp oil is strong yet not that bad, actually you get a great amount of high quality product for a really good price, the packaging is simple to use without any problems and the size is good for the price. Something you should know that this product is for scalp not the ends"
110487,5,"I read and watched a lot of reviews about this product when i used it I know why they love it and it's always out of stock , you should massage the scalp before and after use this oil , the oil helps strengthen the hair and grow baby hair it has a mint rosemary strong scent and the quality , size and packaging is great ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

110487,5,"The oil is very good would recommend for its nourishing feeling on the scalp, it revived my hair and it created a sensation like its breathing from my roots i would recommend for people who are balding and have a weak scalp but dont use it directly rub on ur hands and gently massage it onto your hair, the scent is very good, the size of the oil would last up to two months if you oil ur hair on a daily basis as in (every two days or so). definitely recommend"

110487,5,"I've read and heard so many things about this oil, i'm on the second bottle already. i noticed baby hair growing but my hair isn't getting any longer. i like the smell of it, strong rosemary smell. I will keep using it to see if it will change my hair length."
110487,5,"I have heard a lot about this. Hair oil but i used one time so i will continue and cone add another review, Quality is good,scent is perfect , use is easy, ingredients are good, size is perfect, makes your hair very smooth, good for sensitive scalp moisturize your hair perfectly"
110487,5,"You need a really small amount each time and the size is quite big so the product lasts for a long time. It convenient to use and apply, doesn‚Äôt irritate the scalp and convenient to leave for the entire night as well (however I do change the pillowcase to prevent acne). The scent is strong but not unpleasant for my taste. I‚Äôve been using for 2 weeks, by applying prewash for several hours or overnight so I‚Äôm not sure yet if it‚Äôs beneficial for hair growth. I‚Äôll be back to update :)"
110487,5,This is my second purchase of this oil and it is the number one for me. I put it on my scalp three hours before washing my hair. The scent is amazing and I can see benefits. My hair is so much better now. It shines and its quality has improved. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their hair care routine.
110487,5,"We used it for several weeks, i apply it to my scalp before every wash day and leave for and hour before washing. My hair looks more shinier and healthier, it has a very pleasent scent. It's definitelly high quality product, it has a lot of natural oils in it, that's why i bought it. I feel that it moisturizes my scalp."
110487,5,"Normally, I'm skeptical of social media endorsements, but this product truly impressed me. After struggling with scalp issues for a month, I applied it once overnight, and it provided soothing relief. Additionally, it noticeably softened my hair and made detangling/brushing much easier after washing. Despite usually feeling nauseated by mint scents, this one didn't bother me at all."
110487,5,"Best product i ever used for hair had thin hair my whole life been using it for 3 months now a lot of baby hair it helped strengthen and lengthen my hair ,love the scent really fresh and nice,great quality and packaging size you get a lot of product. I use it with a scalp massager to stimulate hair growth faster love it!!"
110487,5,"The Package came packed safely and the size of the product is perfect been using it for approximately 2 month and my hair started being thicker and the itchiness in my scalp got reduced, i can see a change using the full pack of : Shampoo, mask and oil. I use the oil on a clean hair and scalp for results . Its worth the hype as the amount of baby hair i get is incredible"
110487,5,The best hair product Ive ever used. I put it 1-2 hours before i wash my hair on my scalp and hair. My hair feels much more healthy and shiny since i started using it and i am able to wash my hair only once a week without it becoming oily which is amazing for me.
110487,5,"I've been using the Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil with Rosemary Mint for several weeks now, and it's become a game-changer in my hair care routine. Right from the first application, I noticed an immediate soothing sensation on my scalp, thanks to the refreshing blend of rosemary and mint. The oil is lightweight, making it easy to massage into my scalp without leaving a greasy residue. Not only does it promote a healthier scalp, but I've also noticed reduced hair fall and increased volume in my hair strands. The natural ingredients, especially the rosemary and mint, provide a calming aroma that lingers throughout the day, creating a spa-like experience."
110487,5,this is the second rosemary oil that I bought and there is a difference! my other rosemary oil wasn't nearly as good as this one so I recommend this oil from this company I try to use it once every two weeks on my scalp I really think it helps grow my hair my hair grew so much in one ear the size is totally worth the price it will take you a while to finish because you only use a little at a time it's has a very strong Rosemary scent which I personally don't like but there's nothing really do about it and I still 100% recommend if this helped you please don't forget to like ü´∂üèª
110487,5,"It has the scent of rosemary and mint , i use it on my hair, leave it for 30 minutes twice a week and shower , it soothes the scalp and moisturizes the hair keeping it shiny and healthy, works on sensitive scalp , the quality is amazing and size is ok packaging is cute suitable for every ages"
110487,5,"The Milie Scalp and Hair Strengthening Oil is a nourishing delight. Its quality ingredients and invigorating rosemary mint scent make it a standout. The sleek packaging adds to its appeal. Beyond the pleasant aroma, the moisturizing benefits for both scalp and hair are remarkable. A must-have for anyone seeking a top-quality hair oil in a delightful package."
110487,5,"I have heard a lot about rosemary oil. I decided to give it a try, for me it‚Äôs a strong hair oil (I didn‚Äôt leave it on my scalp more than 15-20mins ) when I am using it my hair starts to fall( and is suppose to do the exact opposite thing ) so I guess it is not working for me or I have a sensitive scalp?! As for the quantity ,the size looks small but you only need a small amount to cover your scalp."
110487,5,"overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience. The ordering process was simple, and the delivery was faster than expected. The product arrived well-packaged and in perfect condition. It matches the description provided online, and the quality is just as good, if not better, than I anticipated. I‚Äôve been using it for a while now, and it works as advertised. Overall, I‚Äôd definitely recommend it!"
110487,5,Love this product! I have been using this once a week for about 6 months now and find it's made a huge difference to my scalp health. I have combination skin and find the original formula is light enough. A little goes a long way so use sparingly. If you want shiny healthy hair. look no further!
110487,5,"I love this oil ! The size is very good vor its price, packaging is fine, i like the applicator. It almost doesn‚Äôt have scent, just a little rosemary smell. I am using maybe 4th bottle of this and its benefit that it helps my hair to grow faster. Just stick to the routine if your scalp is okay with rosemary oil. I don‚Äôt apply it on my length, just on scalp and massaging it. I am seeing the difference on using this + hair massage (MUST), they work great together! I am recommending this oil to all my friends who want to grow hair faster."
110487,5,I've been using this oil on my scalp and hair 1-2x weekly for almost a year. It has been incredibly effective helping my hair to regrow following significant hair loss due to illness. I massage into my scalp and and through my hair and leave in for a couple of hours before washing. It smells lovely and fresh.
110487,5,A bottle with so many benefits. The package came in good condition. the size can last up to 3 months. high quality oil for receeding hair lines. Put the oil on the bald spot on the scalp or the part you need to work on. And wash it off after a few hours.It has a smell could be sensitive for some people
110487,5,"really recommend this ur loosing hair a lot this is for ‚ú® u may not like the scent because im one of them ( it just smell minty üôÇ) but if u want to grow ur hair back bring it. the quality, size, and the packaging is great. I've been using it for 8 months know and really loved it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
110487,5,"I'm absolutely loving this hair product. Other reviews commented on it being greasy but I'm not having that problem. I add a drop or two to my Rogaine at night and leave it in all day. My scalp feels great, I'll update with long-term results in the future."
110487,5,The scent is great the use is easy and the product is high quality the size is a bit small for the price you can use it for all age the packaging is okay not very protective it uas many benefits for the hair and and the follicle and the scalp composition Good for sensitive skin doesn‚Äôt moisturizer
110487,5,This is my third bottle and I love using this oil. I mixed rosemary oil with the organic coconut oil. The smell of this oil is very calming. The size is perfect. I comes with a dropper which makes it so easy to use. The packaging is great and it comes in a glass bottle which I like. It doesn‚Äôt irritate my scalp and also helps with my color treated hair.
110487,5,"I am satisfied with the quality of the oil. Rosemary oil can stimulate hair growth, reduce dandruff, and improve scalp health. Rosemary and mint essential oils can also increase blood circulation to the scalp, which can lead to thicker, faster growing hair.  The aroma of rosemary mint can help you feel more awake, cool, and refreshed. It can also help you focus, concentrate, and clear your mind. One study found that rosemary aromatherapy significantly improved overall memory quality and secondary memory factors."
110487,5,"I‚Äôve been using this oil with other products for hair growth. So I believe that complex helped me to make my hair longer and healthier. It doesn‚Äôt irritate my sensitive scalp, has good natural rosemary scent, the package is comfortable to use and overall it‚Äôs a good composition. Highly recommend to try"
110487,5,"Excellent packaging and great value for the money! The shipping was quick, and although I haven't tried this product yet, I believe it will be good. It seems to be of high quality, and I love the ingredients. I plan to use it on my hair and consume it as well. The size is generous, making it suitable for my skin. I'm hoping it will aid in hair growth, even though this is my first time trying it. Looking forward to the great benefits!"
110487,5,This rosemary mint oil works well to nourish the scalp and you can feel the cool sensation as you massage it into the scalp. But it can be oily so recommend to put & massage into the scalp like 1 or 2 hour before you wash it off so that the product can be fully absorbed.
110487,5,"I use this oil in the morning and combine it with pure castor oil in the evening. I have honestly noticed more baby hair in my hairline and less hair loss when washing my head. Ps.I wash my hair with the Mielle shampoo, so I don't know if the diminishing hair loss is due to the oil or the shampoo or both."
110487,5,"This oil has such a good scent and it feels so good on my hair and scalp. I use it to make my hair more manageable and it moisturizes it so well. It lasts a long time because you don‚Äôt need a lot, so it‚Äôs a foos sized bottle. I feel like this is a very high quality oil!"
110487,5,"I had my thyroid problem that‚Äôs why my hair is thinning. This product works you just need to be consistent to it. It‚Äôs good for those who have sensitive scalp. Its moisturize your hair also. I like the scent it‚Äôs minty. Just put it in your hair, massage it and leave it for few hours then wash. Don‚Äôt leave it overnight. It‚Äôs worth to buy, I‚Äôm definitely buying again."
110487,5,"The scent is lovely. I use it frequently as part of my hair care routine. The composition treats and benefits your scalp and highly moisturizes your hair. Whether it‚Äôs dry or sensitive hair, the quality of this product will do your hair wonders. The size and package are cute. Love it!"
110487,5,"Wow I loved it so much the color is amazing and the quality of the loosing powder is so nice I‚Äôll definitely will be ordering again. The scent is so nice and the size is great, loved it so much, good packing and packaging loved it too, the coverage is beautiful."

110487,5,The scent of it is a little strong but you can tell that it‚Äôs great quality I used it on my self age 19 to help my hair grow especially my scalp it‚Äôs really good even for sensitive scalps it douant really moisturize because that not what it‚Äôs meant to do but there are a lot of benefits such as hair growth after some time and helps keep away lice the packaging and size are great it is made out of glass
110487,5,"I have been using this hair oil for only two weeks, but I am already satisfied with the results. My hair looks better. I have noticed less hair fall. The size is good, and little goes a long way, so the bottle should last quite a while. The package is good, and it is easy to apply it. I highly recommend it"
110487,5,"This rosemary mint scalp and hair oil is amazing! It has a refreshing scent and feels soothing on the scalp. After using it for a few weeks, I‚Äôve noticed my hair feels stronger and less prone to breakage. It‚Äôs lightweight and doesn‚Äôt leave a greasy residue, which is a huge plus. The dropper makes it easy to apply directly to the scalp. Highly recommend for anyone looking to boost hair strength and improve scalp health!"
110487,5,"Amazing for daily use it smells great, and the quality its good for daily routine i personally like using it feels great and the size is nice also the packaging i like it it controls the oil and the face looks matte and the finish is amazing scent is good and composition"
110487,5,"Rosemary oil is of excellent quality, featuring natural ingredients that provide remarkable benefits for hair and nails. The package size is perfect for regular use, and I‚Äôve noticed significant improvements in my hair‚Äôs moisture and scalp health, particularly as I age. Its moisturizing properties help enhance shine and strength, while the refreshing smell is a lovely bonus. The oil is gentle enough for sensitive skin, making it a great addition to my nutrition and beauty routine. I highly recommend rosemary oil for anyone looking to revitalize their hair and promote healthy aging!"
110487,5,"Mielle, Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil, Rosemary Mint, 2 fl oz (59 ml) amazing product, i like it for increase hair health significantly scent is fresh, easy to use , i like product for being natural ,quality is high, size is good ,suitable for all ages, package is nice , benefit , compositions , for scalp sensitive, moisturize Review submitted"
110487,5,I actually use it like at least 3 times a feel for my regular scalp treatment and it shows high effectiveness. I use to deal hair loss like my whole life but it seemed it actually helped and I see much less hair loss while showering or brushing my hair so I really glad I gave it a try and ordered it because I was sceptical at first but I was like let‚Äôs give it a shot‚Äù and I definitely don‚Äôt regret it
110487,5,"I'm recommending this to everyone I know! smells good, easy application everyone can use it. the size isn't big, but it lasts for a long time based on how much you use on your hair. the scent is pure rosemary, which I like. good package and quality. good for sensitive scalps. benefits: limits hair falling, baby hair and growth!"
110487,5,"When rubbed into the scalp a few time a week i can see hair growth is boosted and new small hairs coming in. Warning through - it makes my hair very greasy. I tend to put it on about 2-3 hours before im going to shower because once its in it does not look good! Overnight is also ok."""
110487,5,Great product that helps stimulate hair follicles. The length of his hair increased by half a centimeter
110487,5,"very nice hair serum and so effective, have seen a good result and baby hair start to grow, using this product along with hair vitamin and so satisfied from the result, the smell is good."
110487,5,"The product is distinctive, it tastes great, I recommend trying it, of high quality"
110487,5,"Nice product for female, and very good for hair, make it strong and nice looking."
110487,4,"This oil is good! At first, it made my hair fall out, which was scary, but then it stopped and actually helped my hair grow back. I love it! It does feel a bit hot on the scalp, so I usually apply it for 10 to 15 minutes before washing it off."
110487,4,"It is so light on hair, I like its smell, still too early to see improvement after only a week , I‚Äôll be patient and wait for my hair to get better. I used it on the scalp and on the roots and wait for around 4 hours to wash my hair. The package was perfectly sealed. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase."
110487,4,"I've been using rosemary oil for my hair, and I've noticed some hair growth, though I'm not entirely sure if it's solely due to this product. The packaging is practical and easy to use. The composition seems effective, as it appears to stimulate some hair growth. However, the smell is quite strong and might be overwhelming for some. The oil is easy to apply, and despite the strong scent, the potential benefits are promising. It might be worth trying if you're looking to boost hair growth, but be prepared for the strong aroma."
110487,4,"The oil smells so nice, I love the minty hint. It's very easy to apply and most importantly light weight! I was afraid that it'd make my roots greasy but not at all"
110487,4,It‚Äôs good for the scalp doesn‚Äôt smell bad or anything you can use it everyday it‚Äôs really good makes the hair thicker instead of having thinn hair the size is perfect actually it keeps you for like one two months you can probably use it for any age the benefits are amazing makes your hair longer good hair oils and thick hair so perfect
110487,4,"No scent , easy to use , small size, good composition and moisturizer, soft texture, for any season, suitable for sensitive skin , high quality, for any age, good packaging, amazing benefits, gentle at skin, frequently use, no concern, helps for graw the hair, scalp , No scent , easy to use , small size, good composition and moisturizer, soft texture, for any season, suitable for sensitive skin , high quality, for any age, good packaging, amazing benefits, gentle at skin, frequently use, no concern."
110487,4,"I‚Äôve used this product for about 2 weeks and honestly my scalp feels great, my hairs shiny, it‚Äôs not as greasy as it was before. You‚Äôd think it would leave your hair greasy with residue and nope! This was honestly one was the best hair serums I‚Äôve ever purchased"
110487,4,"Very easy to use the quality is super and has no scent , and size is ok, package is good, suitable for all ages, no color, smooth texture and no sensitivity or concerns for me, I have been using it for more than 5 months and the benefit is amazing, I will buy again. I recommend. Light on scalp and no harm for hair.moisturize and composition are good."
110487,4,"Where to even start with this one ?! The benefits are endless Lowers blood pressure , protects your heart, Improves cholesterol slightly, supports hair growth, and so on Very high quality fish oil, the pills look beautiful and despite their size they are extremely easy to swallow considering how smooth they are I love the package of this Omega 3 as well, strong and efficient"
110487,4,"Has a minty scent, average size compared price, I applied it directly to mu scalp, I don‚Äôt think you can use it and go outside, I would recommend using it before the shower because it leaves the hair very oily, maybe not the best applicate, I will write a second review after I finish the 2 bottles I purchased."
110487,4,Good scent use it before shower 10 to 20 minuets a few drop enough on the scalp and wear plastic hat to increase the benefit of the product its good quality rosemary oil small size but last for long coz u only need few drops I felt my hair moisturize after using and more soft its came well package thx a lot
110487,4,"I can‚Äôt say for sure whether there is a result from using only this oil, since in addition to it I also used other products (biotin, scrub, masks, massage), but a lot of new hair appeared. The composition is safe and suitable for sensitive scalp, the mint smell is very pleasant and refreshing, the size is not large, but lasts a long time. I applied it before washing, left it on for 10-15 minutes, then used shampoo and other hair care products."
110487,4,It was good but I didn‚Äôt stick to itüò≠- The thing is I wanted to use this oil to grow my hair and thickened it but since I was working at a fast food restaurant I found it hard on myself to go home put it on for 20-30 minutes then shower- I didn‚Äôt have time and I‚Äôm too tired for this cuz my shower is already long with my curly hair so all I cared about was washing it and go sleep. I took pictures but can‚Äôt tell if I see any differences it‚Äôs like maybe a little hair grown then I stopped using it so I can‚Äôt blame it it‚Äôs on me. But I know if I use it and stick to it in my routine I‚Äôll see results- speaking after 5 months of getting it but the first 3 was at work I used it once a week then stoppedüò≠I should get back into using it‚Ä¶ Also smells weird but idk when you wash it it‚Äôll go away.
110487,4,My first hair oiling experience at first i didn‚Äôt understand what benefits can i get from oiling because Ive attempted hair oiling before and it didn‚Äôt ended great for me but after understanding the proper process and steps to follow i definitely see results even when ive been inconsistent! The size is perfect as you dont need heepings of it to oil the scalp properly.
110487,4,Easy to use and very nice scent and smell . It Seems good quality Small size. Age less. Expensive as a package. Hope have good benefits for hair and roots. Not sensitive. Moisturize good Good for scalp. I think good composition Hope more offers soon as it is small and expensive.
110487,4,"Mielle Rosemary oil has made my hair feel more refreshed and healthier after use, especially when used in conjunction with their shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner. And i can see how shiny my hair turned every time I look at the mirror ‚ú®‚ú® Also the scent is really refreshing üçÉ Definitely gonna order another bottle üíØ"
110487,4,"The quality , size , packaging,composition are great! It‚Äôs one of the best oils (great benefits).. Has a strong scent(it may not suits sensitive skins); so it‚Äôs better to dilute it with light oils.. it doesn‚Äôt moisturize your hair so try to use it only on ur scalp before showering .. Suitable for all ages"
110487,4,"first thing I like about this product is the feeling that it gives to my scalp, so fresh, and you can sence a bit of warmth like your scalp is being cleaned up, I also used it for the ends of my hair, and wow, my hair is softer now, but remember to not use it on your ends more than 10 minutes, it will over oil them even when you wash your hair. about the results of growth, I still do not know the benefits because I only used it 3 times till now, but I will continue using it, and keep you up to anything new ü§ó. And yes concerning the size of the bottle, of course I wish if it was bigger, because if you want to use it for both scalp and nourishing the ends of your hair, it will vanish faster than using it only for one purpose, so, be economic ü•≤"
110487,4,"I used it for months and I can say that it made my hair long faster, however, it didn't grow a lot of hair for me honestly, I use it on the scalp and massage it, and I heard that it makes the scalp dry but I see the opposite, it moistured my kinda dry scalp, the size is good I used almost half of it in 3months, so yeah that's the benefits I got"
110487,4,"I was super excited to try out this product since my hair is damaged and has split ends. After showering, I applied five drops to my hair, but I found that it made my hair too oily at the end. Then I found that the bottle suggests three different ways to use it. However, based on my experience, I would recommend using it before showering, about 30 minutes in advance. You can even take the opportunity to do a scalp massage, as it helps the product absorb better. Once you hop out of the shower, you'll notice that your hair feels more refreshed, and those split ends will be a thing of the past. Give it a go and see the amazing transformation it can bring to your hair!"
110487,4,"It would be unfair to give a high rating because not enough time has passed for real effect. But, I will say that Rosemary oil is very pleasant to me; when applied, I like the slightly cooling effect. I will write a full review when I see new hairs or less hair loss."
110487,4,"It definitely smells like it's got Rosemary in it (and I say this because I have purchased a few products before claiming to have Rosemary in it, but actually doesn't!) firstly! I've only started using it, so I can't see whether it's helping my hair or not yet.. No tingling sensation when applied, and does make my hair look a bit oily."
110487,4,"Having heard the hype surrounding this hair fall product, I decided to give it a try, but three weeks in, I'm left uncertain about its effectiveness. Packaged in a sleek dark glass bottle, it adds a touch of elegance to my routine. The scent is undeniably pleasant, making each use enjoyable. However, despite regular application, I'm unable to discern any significant difference in my hair fall journey. On the positive side, it doesn't irritate my sensitive scalp, which is a plus. While the size is adequate, I expected more noticeable results by this point. Overall, a decent product, but not the transformative solution I had hoped for."
110487,4,"Rosemary oil for hair we put it in the scalp Perfect we use it every week The scent very good Size, packaging and quality were good also Isn‚Äôt the first time we used it, it‚Äôs very benefit Idk if it for all ages or is it sensitive for someone"
110487,4,i've been using this oil for a month now can't exactly tell already if its beneficial for my hair however i do notice that i've been having new growth recently can't tell if it's bc of the oil or scalp massaging or the supplements i've been taking smells good though
110487,4,"Quality product with nice packaging and good size. My husband applies this daily to his scalp and beard. I use it as well on my scalp as well. Does not grow noticeably more hair, but it does reduce the amount of fallen hair. The scent is pleasant. After use, I massage it in and leave it for an hour, then wash hair as per usual; it leaves my scalp feeling moisturized."
110487,4,I used it it had good result but felt it have burn like effect in my hair the quality is good as it contain good ingredients for hair the size is enough for two or more months. Benefit if you just started taking care of your hair.not recommended for sensitive scalp and have strong mint scent
110487,4,It was my first time using it. It was not as concentrated as the one I used before. I have an oily scalp and most oils don‚Äôt work for me because it makes me break out. This one is much nicer but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using it more than once every two weeks.
110487,4,I started using this about 2 months ago I just use it once a week since I don‚Äôt like oil in my hair except on my days off. It gives your scalp a tingling sensation which I believe is due to the peppermint. Not sure if I‚Äôm reacting to anything since the ingredients can be bad for some people. It did strengthen my hair and I observe less hairfall after using this. I can also see some hair growth. I think it would work better with more frequent usage.
110487,4,"I didn't see massive changes my hair within a few months worth... but the scent was great, and as far as quality, one of the best oils I've used. I'm still going on the bottle though, it's lasting me ages. Postage and packaging was really good."
110487,4,Good quality rosemary oil for anyone who wants to strengthen their hair and/or improve luster. I use it once a week and leave it overnight and this leaves my hair soft and my scalp clean. I purchased it on Amazon the first time but bought it here the second time as it was less expensive on iHerb.
110487,4,I bought because of the benefit for my sensitive scalp and hair. Read a lot of good review about it‚Äôs quality and composition to moisture my aging hair. I use it once a week and i really like the scent. The size is just nice and really hope for long term will help to prevent hair fall. Nice packaging also.
110487,4,"Very helpful for days where I feel my scalp is clogged or itchy, I‚Äôll apply this viscous oil on my scalp and let it sit for 20mins before using their Mielle shampoo twice to wash all the gunk out. It does well in relieving the itch and helping my hair feel healthy and airy again~"
110487,3,"So my scalp is pretty sensitive, I tried using it several times and every time I tried my scalp started to itch and burn, I guess maybe I am allergic to a certain ingredient or that it‚Äôs not for sensitive scalp. Has a strong smell. I personally didn‚Äôt like it but I read a lot of good reviews so I guess it is good for some"
110487,3,"There is nothing special about this oil in my opinion. I bought it because of the hype, but as I already tried other oils and actually making my own for hairgrowth that are more potent, comming cheeper and are probably better quality, I see this one as average and not worth the hype and money. It is also too light for me personaly so I added few drops of other essential oils to make it more potent...so taking that in count that I adjusted it to myself again and used it as a base oil, it wasn't good buy and way more pricey than if I just bought a bottle of organic oil and added  essential oils that provide hairgrowth myself. Also, I can't say much about its benefit on hairgrowth because I'm using many other products and different oils as well as this one (adjusted) sometimes. For all given reasons, I would probably not be buying this again."
110487,3,"I had high hopes for the Mielle Rosemary Mint product after hearing so much hype about it, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. I used it diligently, hoping for noticeable effects, but sadly, I didn't experience any significant difference in my hair health or scalp condition."
110487,3,"Size age package quality use scent benefit composition moisturize, hair, scalp sensitive It give me white hairs I was afraid of using it honestly you are better off using boitn and gelatin supplements for hair as well as rosemary water and a moisture barrier conditioner smells nice you need to be"
110487,3,"it grows hair, but i havent seen a massive change in the span of the couple of months that I have been using it. It has an interesting scent, and I loved the packaging and how it felt on my scalp. But, I feel like the quality of the product doesnt benefit my hair type much."
110487,3,"Alright so listen to me carefully. It is truly affective but please stay away from the brand shampoo. It does moisturize the scalps and it helps with growing new hair but use it correctly. The scent is decent and the size should be enhanced tbh. Overall, the quality is decent."
110487,3,This product is foe the hair and scalp i used it a couple of times but i think my scalp is sensitive so i used a small drops on the areas that i think needs moisture but the scent is strong and the size is good for trying it for the first time i will give it a few tries but overall i don‚Äôt think its as good as everyone claims
110487,3,"Might be overhyped, I use this on my scalp every time before I wash my hair and do the whole waiting for a few hours ritual and it hasn‚Äôt transformed my hair. Cute product though, if you can find a cheaper one get it because all those rosemary oils are the same."
110487,3,"I used it but my hair start falling , i gave it another chance and mixed it with castor oil but i still feel my hair is falling. So i decided to stop using it. I think it is not made for my hair type which is fine and wavy. The scent is minty."
110487,3,"I previously used castor oil mixed with rosemary oil which was working. Then I swapped to this for convenience, but am unsure of its potency. The liquid is quite thin, not thick like castor oil and it takes a lot to cover a chunk of your scalp. I dont think I will repurchase."
110487,3,"It is good for moisturizing the hair before showering,, didn‚Äôt notice improvement yet related to hair loss and thickness.. probably need to use it for long time to have solid opinion about it.. in general I will keep using it twice weekly before shower and hope to see the good results"
110487,3,"I‚Äôve been using this rosemary mint oil for a few months, and while I do like the way it feels on my scalp, the results have been a bit slow. The minty sensation is refreshing, and it helps soothe an itchy scalp, but I haven‚Äôt noticed significant hair growth just yet. The oil is lightweight, which is nice because it doesn‚Äôt make my hair greasy, but it can feel a little heavy if I use too much. The scent is pleasant, though it might be a bit strong for those sensitive to minty fragrances. The 2 fl oz bottle is on the smaller side, and while a little goes a long way, it can run out quickly if you‚Äôre using it regularly. Overall, it‚Äôs a good product for scalp health, but you may need to be patient to see noticeable results in hair strength or growth."
110487,3,"it has a strong cooking oil smell and leaves a sticky residue. i cannot use it after washing my hair like i do with other scalp oils. i expected it to be more lightweight. still, i think it has its benefits. i used it by applying a couple of hours prior to washing my hair and massaging the scalp thoroughly. it can also be used to soften dry ends"
110487,3,"OK quality and decent scent although composed of a range oils in addition to rosemary and peppermint. Good size; however, not so easy to use as the pipette leaked when moving between bottle and scalp. This is a decent product, but prefer pure Rosemary oil mixed with Castor oil for noticeable hair growth."
110487,3,I haven't already used it for a month but it's very oily and hard to remove from the skin. The scent is very strong but it's a good scent. The quality seems to be good. The bottle is full and the size of the bottle is good but I guess it's just oil
110487,3,"I started using this about 20 days ago (every day). I apply it to my scalp and the length of my hair. However, I have not noticed any new or faster growth, my hair breaks and falls just as much as before. The oil did give my hair extra softness and is useful to scrunch my hair after using gel. Also, it prevents my hair from getting greasy or dry, so it's a nice balance. Smells nice and strong at the beginning but the smell fades quickly. I do not think I'll buy this again"
110487,2,"Didn‚Äôt do much for my hair or hair growth. Used it on my hairline for months and there was no change even when combined with a humectant like aloe Vera. This product had a lot of hype but it doesn‚Äôt live up to it. Correct supplementation, diet and pumpkin seed oil worked better to grow my hair and make it stronger."
110487,2,"Maybe I'm not using it correctly, but I felt it caused me more hair loss when I went to the shower. People praise its benefits, but I'm not sure about them or its quality. Disappointed. Maybe I have a sensitive scalp. The size is regular, and it has a strong scent."
110487,2,"After reading rave reviews on this product, I decided to purchase it and give it a try to see if it could help with lesser hair loss. Alas, I was not able to use it as often as I should because I find the product to be abit too oily for my liking, even tho I only use a small amount. The scent is okay, the package and size of the product is acceptable. However, it is not a product whereby you can apply it post hair wash and go out with it. It can only be used if you‚Äôre at home since it is so oily, and even then I hate soiling my pillows due to the oiliness. Will not repurchase."
110487,2,"After almost using the whole bottle, I realized this very popular product is not suitable for everyone. Definitely not for me. I believe the main reason is the lack of instructions. There's so many do's and don'ts online where I ended up getting lost. I'm not sure why the company doesn't provide better directions. After doing a lot of research, I found out it works best after leaving it on for around an hour and the washing off, shampooing it two or more times. It turns out if you don't wash it out well, it can clog the hair follicles and end up having hair loss. Anyway that's a long process for someone who doesn't have time to do that twice a week. As far as results go, I can't attest to anything positive or negative."
110487,1,"been using this for a month or more, once or twice a week to stop hair thinning around my part and frontal hairline from stress (telogen effluvium). don't know why I didn't realise til tonight but it's actually made my hair loss WORSE! I'm immediately stopping using it, and back to Minoxidil. hope it grows back, I'm so upset. I've lost all the regrowth I painstakingly gained before starting it, thinking I was doing the right thing. even tho I needed to grow back more still it's put me back to square one. I think maybe it's too strong for some people? not a risk I want to push through..."
110487,1,"I‚Äôm convinced the positive reviews are all spam because it‚Äôs absolutely terrible and I do NOT recommend. I had to deep cleanse my hair afterwards to get the oil out. It‚Äôs completely awful and going in the trash. It‚Äôs by far the worst hair and scalp serum I‚Äôve tried. First, it‚Äôs challenging to apply because when you remove the dropper oil immediately starts dripping everywhere. Because of this it‚Äôs challenging to apply directly to your scalp so I put some in the palm of my hands but it still got all over my hair while applying. And it‚Äôs greasy. Even a small amount made my freshly washed hair incredibly greasy, weighed down, and looked like it hadn‚Äôt been washed in awhile. Perhaps you could apply the oil before washing but a) this is not always convenient and b) it really required a deep clean, double wash, to get out. I‚Äôve attached two photos showing the result on freshly washed and dried hair. There are far better options instead such as follicle stimulating sprays which are effective, and which you can spray on damp or dried hair without noticing, style as normal, and they‚Äôre not greasy."
110487,1,Now I finally understand the hype! After 3 months of using it I can see baby hair growing out! Noticed a little bit of difference in hair loss but I keep my hopes up after some time! The scent is subtle and doesn‚Äôt bother me. My scalp is less itchy. The size is really good and goes for a while if you‚Äôre oiling two times to 3 times a week. Looking forward to seeing more improvements in my hair for the next 3 months! Edit; my hair went crazy! I realized it is so heavy for my hair. Became so greasy on the scalp yet so frizzy too! Hair loss increased so I stopped using it.
110487,1,Read my review before you buy. It can save you from the situation I am in now. I bought their entire hair care set because I saw a lot of positive reviews. I learned a very important life lesson from this and that is to read the low reviews even if there are tens of thousands of good reviews and even if the product is ranked first according to iherb. I used the oil twice. The first time I had severe shedding. It really bothered me so I went searching and found many similar cases. I tried again to apply the oil thinking that maybe it was accidental. But the second time the shedding was even worse. I'm writing this review seriously because it doesn't make sense that a product that claims to strengthen hair and is ranked number one on iherb for hair products causes hair loss in so many cases. I do not recommend buying this product especially if you are dealing with hair loss. The end result is less hair on the head and less money in your pocket.
6418,5,"great gel with no scent at all. feels high quality with good composition, package is pretty good size. I put it after shower and then flop my hair in a shirt. I used it a couple of times already and my hair looks great :) I would recommend to anyone with curly hair."

6418,5,"This product was recommended by a wavy hair influencer. My curls are more defined and does not leave a hard cast. However, because my hair is on the frizzier side, I still get some frizz and undefined strands here and there. When I tried to use it to style my baby hairs in front, I find it doesn‚Äôt give the strongest hold but still lasts a few hours. In terms of scent, it smells like any typical gel, and size is great and lasts a while."

6418,5,"After using this for the first time i can see it cleans my brushes well. The only problem is the package, it‚Äôs very liquidy i would rather have a normal disc cap to dispense the soap. Good size and quality. Also it‚Äôs colourful and packaged in black. Texture is quite runny! Overall still a good product (copy paste) but good product it‚Äôs not runny bought it multiple times"
6418,5,"This gel has been my favorite for over a year now. Perfectly structures the curl and fits with any product. Can be used solo, or with cream or livin. Spray your palms with water before use, so it will be better distributed throughout your hair. For styling you need all the roller, and the volume of the product is excellent! In general, price-quality is excellent"
6418,5,"The quality is really great , Its size is big for me , I used it once when I was trying to curl my hair and it was nice , I have an oily scalp and I heard that it should not be applied to the scalp, so I put it in my hand and then pressed my hair from below to fix the curls"
6418,5,"This gel is incredible. The hold is fantastic, and it doesn't flake or have that dandruff look. It keeps my curls soft and defined. I do tend to use a lot of gel (with all brands, not just this) so I wish there was an option to buy in a tub or a larger tube."
6418,5,"This offers a strong hold without crunchiness or flakes. It has a mild scent. Suitable for all hair types, even in humidity. I used it on my damp hair and made my curly hair less frizzy. Its natural formula is appreciated for leaving no sticky residue. I would definitely purchase this again."
6418,5,"the scent doesn't have any fragrance it's so useful and the quality is good the size would be better if it's bigger i think it's okay for all ages and the packaging ,is strong and it has benefits for sure the composition is great and it cleans the hair and the scalp as well it might be a little be strong for sensitive people .it needs moisture"
6418,5,"It does not have a strong aroma, but it truly keeps the moisture in and benefits the composition. I really love it and would order again. This gel is the greatest to use on hair and sensitive scalps. It is very amazing for the size, age, and quality of the box."
6418,5,"I love this product the size is perfect and i have been using this for almost 6 months and still has lots of product so definitely will last me for more 3 months! Has no strong scent, my hair has good cast after it and feels moisturized. Will buy this again!"
6418,5,"I have tried a couple of gels as I am new to treating my hair wavy, and this has been by far the best. I have low porosity, thick hair. This gel has given me the best hold, and made my hair feel very soft without cast. Waves held ok on the second day but hair overall feels nice. Also it had the best price out of all the gels I bought!!! Will buy again for sure"
6418,5,This product it‚Äôs amazing. I really like using gel on my Curly Hair. It has a stronghold that make my hair silk and make my curl last longer the size of this product is suitable it‚Äôs a high-quality product. I really recommend you guys to buy it.
6418,5,"scent is great, I use on every washday! quality is amazing and size is big considering the price. good for all ages, and packaging is good. benefits my curly hair, good composition, cannot apply to scalp and not related to scalp sensitivity. moisturizes the hair and leaves it shiny! I love this product and will definitely repurchase"
6418,5,"The use of it is puting small amount of it on your hands and put it on wet hair , the benefit of it that it keeps the curls on bouncy and healthy is easy to use and the packaging is easy to usr the size of it is medium put it lasts forever"
6418,5,"This is a great brand, but I can't get gels to work for me. I got this product on sale and so I thought I would try it but I won't repurchase. I have wavy hair so I can't get things that weigh my hair down. The mousse worked better, but didn't have the last power I was looking for. But good packaging and price point is fair as well. Really great ingredients though and smells so good! Just a light fresh smell, but not overpowering Works for someone following the curly hair method ."
6418,5,If you are looking for a strong gel but organic please go for it. It really keeps my hair in place for long hours and I don‚Äôt feel afraid from the hair fall. The size is really good and I bought long time ago and still have some in bottle to use.
6418,5,"I've tried several gels for my curly wavy hair but I come back to this and tend to have a stash of 2 or 3 in my cupboard so I don't run out. It has a strong hold but this is what I love, enabling me to only have to wash twice a week and rarely needing to refresh. I use it as last step in every wash. It is low scent, but can be sticky so make sure you can wash your hands straight after."
6418,5,"I recently purchased the Gel from iHerb, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! This gel is perfect for everyday use, whether you're styling your hair or simply need a quick fix for flyaways. What I love most about it is its lightweight formula, which doesn't leave any greasy residue behind. Plus, the scent is refreshing and not overpowering at all."
6418,5,"This gel came recommended by a friend, and let me tell you, it's got some serious holding power. My hair is a wild beast sometimes, especially with a bit of humidity, but this stuff keeps it in check. Here's the good: Holds like a boss: Seriously, this gel is no joke. My spikes stayed put all night at that crazy dance party, even with some headbanging involved. No helmet head: Unlike some gels, this one doesn't leave your hair feeling like a crunchy mess. It provides a strong hold without feeling stiff or unnatural. Bonus points for the scent: It has a light, pleasant smell that's not overpowering."

6418,5,"The size is big and enough for a decent time. I use it on wet hair and it has a scent. The quality and composition of this product is great (styling for any age). It is in a tubal package. It is a gel so I don‚Äôt apply it directly on the scalp and it doesn‚Äôt moisturize the hair (if you have dry, damaged and sensitive skin it is okay to use it)."
6418,5,"Amazing care product nice smell and wonderful effect on my skin and the scent on my mood. Nice moisturizer. I use it twice a day and can‚Äôt be more satisfied.the size is good and can stay for more than a month with you. Excellent quality and package.

6418,5,"I have 3b hair and sometimes mousse doesn't hold my bangs completely, they tend to frizz faster, so I just apply a small amount and it hold the curl in place, no flyaways and defined just how I like it! It has a nice mellow scent and the bottle size will surely last me a long time :)"
6418,5,"best gel ever, it never leaves my curls crunchy and it sure hold them until the third day. i feel like the package has become somewhat underwhelming? maybe if put in a container it'd be better. what i also noticed is it never leaves my scalp flaky even when i accidentally apply it on my roots as opposed to other gels i used which caused me dandruff like flakiness."
6418,5,"Great retainer! It does not feel sticky on the hair and is resistant at the same time. I use it on a daily basis and after shampooing. The smell is not felt. Very economical to use (one package was enough for about 2-3 months). Hair does not dry at all, performs its duties."
6418,5,Great strong gel refreshing scent i use only a little bit to not end up with a hard cast really great for locking in moisture and holding curls in humid weather great quality size and packaging my hair really benefits from this during humid days i try to not reach it to my scalp
6418,5,I'm at the age that once I find a good product for my hair I stick to it. The scent is not too strong. I use it everyday when i go to work. The clean ingredients also make me feel comfortable to use on my children. Im pleased with the package size and quality as well.

6418,5,"‚ÄúI was a little worried about ordering with all the bad reviews, but for a 30.00 order I said what the heck and give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised when everything I ordered came quickly and packed very well.

6418,5,"been using Giovanni hair products for a while now, and I must say they live up to their reputation. Giovanni offers a wide range of hair care products that cater to various hair types and concerns. What stands out the most to me is the brand's commitment to using high-quality, natural ingredients that are free from harsh chemicals. The **Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat Shampoo** is one of my favorites. It leaves my scalp feeling refreshed and invigorated, thanks to the cooling sensation from the tea tree, peppermint, and eucalyptus oils. It effectively cleanses my hair without stripping it of its natural oils, which is a big plus for anyone looking to maintain healthy, balanced hair. Another product that has impressed me is the **Giovanni Smooth As Silk Conditioner**. It deeply hydrates and smoothens my hair, leaving it soft and manageable without feeling heavy or greasy. This conditioner works wonders for my dry, frizzy hair, making it feel silky smooth and easy to style. Overall, Giovanni hair products have become a staple in my hair care routine. The combination of natural ingredients, effective formulas, and affordable prices make them a standout choice for anyone looking to elevate their hair care regimen. I highly recommend giving Giovanni a try if you‚Äôre seeking products that deliver salon-quality results with a more natural approach."

Here‚Äôs my experience with it: Strong hold without stiffness: The main thing I love about this gel is its ability to provide strong hold without making my hair feel rock-hard. It keeps my hairstyle in place throughout the day, even in humid conditions, but my hair still feels touchable and not like it's glued down. Perfect for those who want a solid, long-lasting hold but still like some flexibility. Natural ingredients: Giovanni markets itself as a more natural brand, and the gel is made with ingredients like aloe and other plant-based extracts. It‚Äôs great to find a product that works well without being loaded with harsh chemicals, especially if you‚Äôre someone who prefers to use clean beauty products. I haven‚Äôt experienced any irritation on my scalp, which is a plus for me. Non-flaking: Unlike some gels that leave white flakes after drying, this one doesn‚Äôt. I can run my fingers through my hair without worrying about it flaking or looking like dandruff, which has been an issue with other gels I‚Äôve used before. Good scent: The fragrance is light and pleasant, not overpowering. It doesn‚Äôt clash with other products I use, which is nice."

6418,5,"I mean, the scent is unbelievable like all this brand products! It holds everything in place, non greasy, doesn‚Äôt leave any white marks, not crumbles with time ! Best hair products"
6418,5,I have used this product many times and keep going back because it's very effective and holds my hair in place without being sticky. It only takes a small amount to work.
6418,5,"Overall I like this product, but I find it very drying to my hair, so I use it with a leave-in conditioner. I also style my eyebrows with this gel, it turns out great, better than any eyebrow gel."
6418,5,"holds my curly hair very well, doesnt feel sticky, and leaves curles very accurately and curly"
6418,5,"Great hold and nice smell, isn‚Äôt flaky or sticky. Has a really great smell too. Giovanni products are great!"
6418,5,She uses this for her very curly hair. The ingredients are non toxic which is a bonus.
6418,5,"Best Quality ingredients , build immune system after taking this. More energy .highly recommended ."
6418,5,I brought it for my two boys and it‚Äôs fantastic
6418,5,"I love it, good size, i use it for my curly hair"
6418,5,Great scent perfect use high quality perfect size hold the hair perfectly it has a bit odd moisturizer
6418,5,"Like the fresh scent , good for curly hair style not affecting the scalp"
6418,5,"Great hold, does not leave it stick or unpleasant. But price has crept up over the year. That's the only downside."
6418,5,Love this product! Great value for money and really works well. Not sticky
6418,5,Quality is super! The ingredients are great! Size arranged! What you need! Performance is felt!
6418,5,I recommend too buying it‚Äôs quality and good use
6418,5,Great gel at a very good price. Provides perfect definition to curls and compatible with CGM
6418,4,"When I first ordered it I used it, I liked it it‚Äôs good You can style it it‚Äôs actually easy to style with wet hair, like after I‚Äôm done with my curly hair routine I put a little bit of it on my hand rub it and scrunch It‚Äôs really easy it‚Äôs like cream it doesn‚Äôt feel heavy and lasts the entire week, however I felt like it makes my hair frizzy so I stopped using it and stuck with glaze- I haven‚Äôt tried it in forever to confirm if it does actually make the hair frizzy or not but I will do it again. Smells fine it‚Äôs like plastic idk how to describe it it‚Äôs like fine but plasticy at the same time if it makes senseüò≠. So yeah idk It‚Äôs easy to style not heavy or anything and lasts the entire week, but made my hair more frizzy for some reason."
6418,4,Scent And use quick Size is good Quality also Can use for curly hair with no sensitive It‚Äôs moisture Package is good Can be used for any age i think I have benefits from this product Composition Scalp Really nice and smooth Likkkkkke it ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Really nice and smooth Likkkkkke it ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
6418,4,"Nice gel, however with my super thin hair it is a bit tricky to apply an even amount so the hair is not all glued. I mix it with water however and appreciate the composition. The scent doesn't bother me and when used correctly leaves my curls looking great. The size will last for a long time."
6418,4,"the scent is like alcohol but when you put it on your hair it doesn't appear,l use it after leave in ,the size is Satisfying,the package is so pretty it does not make my hair frazzy, good for sensitive hair ,l have curly hair so it have medium hold ,my age 18,I really like it,and I think it perfect for wavy and curly hair."
6418,4,"Scent is good and it makes my 3a curly hair less frizzy and shiny also its not that strong and doesnt make a lot of gel cast , if you think its sticky it goes away while defusing so dont worry! The packaging is very good too and has enough product"
6418,4,"I have medium hair, medium density, and various porosities all over my head. I find that this isn‚Äôt as strong hold as advertised and doesn‚Äôt give me any cast on its own. Definition is better than other stylers I‚Äôve tried but where this really shines is when it‚Äôs layered with other gels! I get great hair that lasts 3-4 days when paired with the Harry‚Äôs Sculpting Gel. The scent is a mild aloe vera which I personally don‚Äôt mind, and it didn‚Äôt give my dandruffy scalp any issues. I don‚Äôt struggle with dryness so my hair felt quite soft with it on."
6418,4,"Excellent product But personally, I am less attached to the texture of gels on my hair I like to feel that the curls are free And he holds them too tightly for me In the end, for people who want a strong hair hold, this is an excellent product for them"
6418,4,"Almost no scent, good size, easy to use package. It doesn't leave the hair very hard like old fashioned gells, but you can still feel there is some rigid product in the hair. Overall quite nice, probably would be most useful for a tight ponytail to smooth out fringe"
6418,4,"I bought this product to define my curls after showering because it has no harmful ingredients or drying alcohol in it. While it keeps your hair hydrated, it is a bit too thick for my taste and not suitable for curls. But given all the other benefits, I'd still recommend this product to anyone who is searching for a clean hairstyling product for sensitive hair and scalp."
6418,4,"Gives a great hold and doesn't feel producty when my hair dries. There wasn't any white flakes when I shook my hair either (which some other strong hold gels do). Good price for the amount you get too. I like that the tube is clear, you can see how much there is left too."
6418,4,"It gives a strong cast to curly hair, but you have to use a really good amount. The consistency is thick, so it‚Äôs better to use it on completely soaked hair or dilute it with water which will make it easier to work with. It doesn‚Äôt control the frizz completely and I didn‚Äôt like the sticky feeling of the gel on my hands. I‚Äôll have to test it more to see if it still keeps the locks in shape after a few days or not. The scent smells like shampoo. It needs good moisturizing like using a good hair make, conditioner etc. before applying the gel."
6418,4,"This gel works really well on my coily kinky hair. A small amount of the gel goes along way. My scalp is very sensitive and I have to watch what I use. So if you have a very arable scalp, I would say not to use too much of this product. It also does flake."
6418,4,"it is good hair gel if you are looking for something that will hold your hair down. however, be aware that this isn't one of the gel products that you can use, and as time goes by, the gel will break down naturally, you have to wash/rinse your hair after using the gel, otherwise, the gel will stay on your hair."
6418,4,"I used curly girl method on my freezy hair, it helped me to form curls. The composition is nice, it‚Äôs not sticky, doesn‚Äôt make hair greasy even if you touch your scalp with it. If you‚Äôre more proficient in making curls, you‚Äôd probably appreciate and benefit from it more, since for me it wasn‚Äôt a strong hold. Size is good, this package would last long"
6418,4,"This gel provides a good yet soft hold. It also washes out well. The only thing I don't like about it is that no matter how little I use, it leaves my hair with a wet appearance. I am aware the product is supposed to add shine but I don't like how it looks in my hair."
6418,4,"This gel is nice one but i feel like it doesn't live up to my expectations regarding to it strength-it has a medium to strong hold, and not super strong. I find it best combined with a moisturizer underneath and it can be re activated, and give a nice result. Hence it is quite economical if you dont wash your hair daily. Has a slite scent which i find nice."
6418,4,"no annoying scent to it, i use it by scrunching an amount of it on my curls while my hair is wet. it‚Äôs good quality but i feel like there are stronger holding gels personally. however this is still great if you‚Äôre going for volume and not so much for the definition."
6418,4,"So interesting, doesn‚Äôt leave your hair crunchy or hard and doesn‚Äôt leave any visible dry residue. Beware of using it on dry hair though - it really dried my hair out and because my hair is fine it got knotted and was nearly impossible to get the knots out. I would only use it on wet or damp hair, i‚Äôve sprayed my hair damp with a spray bottle and applied the gel then instead of applying it to my dry strands. It was so hard to get the knots out the time I applied it to dry hair. No scent, great size for the price."
6418,4,"There is no scent , the use is just apply it at any part of your hair if wanted a slick back for example or just for curly hair . Quality is good, size it will last you long, benefit holds the hair , packaging is great . Age lasts, moisture a little . Composition."
6418,4,"It‚Äôs not the best, makes the hair look greasy and doesn‚Äôt hold the hair well, i put it on my hair on top for slicked back but some of my baby hair would still pop out. I honestly expected it to be much better."
6418,4,"It have a good scent,I think it‚Äôs good and doesn‚Äôt ruin the hair like other products that hold hair and the size is great it‚Äôs bigger than expected"
6418,4,Not the easiest gel to use because it‚Äôs very thick but gives a great hold on curly hair and for the price is just fab!
6418,4,I have curly hair and it give a nice medium hold. It dries my hair a littler bit on a second day- but I still like it. It doesn‚Äôt give me sticky feeling in a humid climate

6418,4,"When I first started on the curly girl method, this was the first gel I purchased. It definitely has a very strong hold, but too strong for my fine hair. So I gifted it to my cousin who has very thick hair and it works absolutely wonders for her."
6418,4,Nice gel! Good quality and holds the hair well. It has a slight scent. The size is good too it will last a long time
6418,4,"The hold of this hair gel is not that strong, but it doesn‚Äôt make your hair sticky, my son and husband use it daily, the scent is also very good"
6418,4,scent: good use: i use it for the first time yesterday and i wake up my hair is shiny and not sticky‚ú® quality: good size: kinda big age: i think it will last package: good benefit: composition: the best hair gel scalp: no sensitive: no moisturize: yess
6418,4,The product works well for slicked back hairstyles when my hair is not looking good. I also use it on my eyebrows. It is great that it doesn't leave my hair dry after using it.
6418,4,"I have stubborn hair that won't hold with some gels, this one was easy to apply and not sticky and also not flaky, works good when you tie hair down. It does not have a strong scent at all."
6418,4,"Good price for the size. I like the scent, not too strong. I use it to style my hair after washing it. I wouldn‚Äôt say it strong hold, maybe a medium hold, or maybe I‚Äôm not using enough üòÖ"
6418,4,I loved it because it helps in styling and give a nice look for the hair. Looking fresh and not oily The size is big with good quality as all of giovanni products
6418,4,I originally purchased it for my wavy hair routine it is heavy made my hair oily so now i use to do sleek bun or ponytail works great for that
6418,4,"Great hair gel. For hours, the hair remains still! doesn't aggravate my sensitive scalp, which is something I have. doesn't cause lumps or white spots on the hair. a subtle, enjoyable aroma. The spacious, user-friendly container makes it well worth the cost."
6418,4,"Not quite right for my hair type but it's good quality, has a good scent and would work well for someone with curly hair looking for a strong hold"
6418,4,"I was previously using a product from my barber, but it has too many chemicals. I tried this, and although I have to use more of the product to get the same hold, it feels lighter in my hair."
6418,3,It didn‚Äôt had a scent I used it for my curly hair It‚Äôs size is big I didn‚Äôt use it frequently so it lasted a year But actually I didn‚Äôt like its hold it made my hair grease But it is good for hair edges Its quality is good
6418,3,"if given the perfect weather conditions (aka staying indoors in airconditioning), this gel sorta works, but it definitely can't handle humid Singapore. Really tried my best to like it, but it ends up frizzing up my hair. I didn't get much use out of it and have moved on to Cantu (which really works!). Size is decent for the price."
6418,3,I purchased it many time at first i like it alot and it gave my hair strong hold but a bit frizzy (i have 3a curly hair type) but with time and long period use it became liss and liss hold on my hair and when i use it now it gave a lott of frizz and didnt gave volume and strong hold for me
6418,3,"Used it 2-3 times I Just didn‚Äôt like it, i have wavy and smooth and it made it feel so rough and stiff that I couldn‚Äôt even run my hand through it. Also the cast was hard to remove ( i mean it does say strong hold). Might be suitable for other ppl though"
6418,3,I had very high hopes for this gel after seeing so many reviews but I thinks it‚Äôs okay. I haven‚Äôt tried many other gels so I can‚Äôt really compare. The size of the package is great and little goes a reallllly long way so be careful if you‚Äôre using it to define your curls.
6418,3,Medium hold. I layer this gel with mousse and another gel but this Giovanni gel is what tames my frizz and helps my curls to be defined
6418,3,No scent The quality is great No frizz after using it and the hold is powerful The only issue is that I ended up having zero volume ( I have thin hair)
6418,3,Light scent I used it for 3 years in a row Hold curls very well Size is a bit small Packaging not bad The texture is thick Makes hair look shiny Locks moist in your locks
6418,3,The scent is nice not very harsh smell you should put it on your scalp it frizzes your hair you can use it on wet skin
6418,3,"I have coily hair and this only gave my hair about a medium hold. Lovely product, i just don't think it was made for my hair."
6418,3,I herb products become costly.No big different in prices between local shops and your prices.this leads me to decrease my shopping in I herb
6418,3,Easy to use The scent is nice The quality great The size is smalllüòî I loved the package It holds my hair for long time
6418,3,"I like the hold from this gel but it seems to be a bit drying and flaky if you comb/brush after it's applied for awhile. The hold is very good, though. I like it for holding my curls but it can get crunchy."
6418,3,"It does not hold for a long time, it makes the hair beautiful, curly, but it does not hold and wipes it straight, but rather makes it wavy, and this does not suit me."
6418,3,"I‚Äôm not so sure about it, I love the shampoos of this brands so I wanted to try other products. This gel I used to hold waves on my hair but I felt my hair getting heavy and even more difficult to hold the waves"
6418,3,was looking for a gel that wouldn't make my hair crunchy. I used it once to be fair so might need to give it another try
6418,3,"It's also easy to apply and doesn't flake throughout the day. However, it has a noticeable scent that might not appeal to everyone. Overall, it's a reliable choice for achieving a lasting and controlled hairstyle."
6418,3,"It‚Äôs easy to wash, but don‚Äôt put too much on your hair because it‚Äôs thick.. my hair lasts for hours didn‚Äôt face any problems or any white flakes"
6418,3,"I didn't notice that much difference in my hair when I used it, maybe make it a little bit less messy"
6418,3,I used it only once because it leaves the hair white ü•∫ won‚Äôt buy it again.
6418,2,"I've got very soft fluffy wavy hairs, they can't hold a shaped curls, so I need a very strong hold gel. Unfortunately, this styling gel does not suit for my type: it makes my hair heavier so the curl become unrolled, also hairs feel so dry, almost damaged, and even rich conditioners and leave-in-products did not help. I used it for a month and my hairs became unruly and very dry. Now I use another one gel from iHerb and its way more better."
6418,2,I dont think I know how to use this. My hair was so crunchy I could not handle it. My scalp had no effect but I dont think this moisturize or anything. Packaging and size is okay but I dont think this benefit me. There was no scent either. Quality is okay I guess but not for me
6418,2,I think it dries my hair out. I have thick frizz prone usually dry wavy hair. I wanted a gel that will help me define my waves and tame the frizz. I didn‚Äôt see any improvements. My hair was stiff and crunchy. I won‚Äôt purchase again. I think this company‚Äôs products best be used on low porosity thin hair. As far as I remember it has no scent.
6418,2,"Very dry to my hair. I tried to experiment with the amount of gel, combine with other gels, change the amount of leave-in, but the hair is still dry. 2b-2c, thick/medium, high density"
6418,2,Nice scent but didn't really do much for me. Made my hair crunchy and frizzy when it's normally just soft and bouncy. Wanted to get a gel to lengthen between refreshes but this fell short. Ok packaging too and I guess the price point is fair.
6418,2,"This gel is quite thick and not the easiest to work into my hair, which is long, wavy (2B) and fine. The end result I get also tends to be kind of... sticky? Tacky? Not shiny? I find that if I don't use enough of this gel, it doesn't offer enough hold. But if I use more, it makes my hair look dull and feel tacky. It's just not the product for me."
6418,1,"I used this twice and it has completely dried out and damaged my long curly hair. The first time I used a medium amount and found it very heavy on the hair, making it look dirty. The second day my hair was a mess. The second time I used this gel i used less, but I still found it made my hair look dull and dirty. I was also not happy with the curl hold and support. The worse thing about this though is really the lasting dryness, despite reverting back now to my previous hair products. From now on i will stick with my all time favourite gel: Original Sprout, Classic Collection, Classic Hair Gel. The Original Sprout may not have a super curling effect but it coats & controls the curls nicely, makes my hair silky and soft, and is not at all drying."
6418,1,"Horrible gel. I have fine, curly hair & this was wayyy to heavy for my hair. Also made it very dry, frizzy & sticky feeling. Smell wasn't anything special. Don't use if you have fine hair that gets weighed down easily."
6418,1,"OK, I gave this gel many many chances. And it is not good. I don't know what exactly makes it this way, but it is super drying to my hair. I used a lot, used a little bit, put it on very dam and moisturised , usual hair routine, semi-dried hair. The result was the same always. My hair was frizzy and dried and second day was horrible because hair would be set the way it spent the night and there was nothing that helped me fix it. Not recommending anyone who follows CG method."
